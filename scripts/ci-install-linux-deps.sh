#
# Installs the Linux system packages `zig build` needs on a GitHub-hosted
# `ubuntu-24.04` runner. Shared by all three Linux jobs in
# .github/workflows/ci.yml (backend's Ubuntu cell, functional-test,
# functional-test-ui) — they are separate jobs on separate VMs, so each one
# has to call this itself.
#
# Why a script rather than an inline step: the package list used to be
# copy-pasted into three places, and when it was wrong it was wrong in all
# three at once. One file, one list.
#
# Two install helpers, because they answer different questions:
#   apt_install <pkg>...  every one of these must exist; fail loudly if not
#   apt_any <alt>...      install the FIRST of these that exists (for
#                         packages Debian renamed between releases)
#
# The `t64` names are the Ubuntu 24.04 "64-bit time_t" transition:
# libasound2 -> libasound2t64, libcups2 -> libcups2t64, libatk1.0-0 ->
# libatk1.0-0t64. This step probes for a real install candidate rather
# than trusting a name, so it keeps working if the image is bumped to a
# distro that uses the old names again.

set -euo pipefail

# Exit 0 only when apt has an actual installable candidate. `apt-cache
# show` is NOT used as the probe: its exit code for an unknown package has
# varied across apt releases, which turns a missing package into either a
# silent skip or a confusing "E: Unable to locate package" on a real one.
#
# `grep -c`, NOT `grep -q`, and that is load-bearing under `set -o
# pipefail`: `grep -q` exits on the first match and closes the pipe, so
# apt-cache dies on SIGPIPE and the pipeline reports failure even though
# grep matched. Every package then looks unavailable and this script
# installs nothing while still exiting 0 on the failure path. `grep -c`
# consumes all input, so no SIGPIPE. It still exits 1 on zero matches,
# which is the signal we want.
