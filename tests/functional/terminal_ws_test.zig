//
// ─── WHY THE WEBSOCKET IS HAND-ROLLED ───────────────────────────────────────
// Zig 0.16's stdlib has NO WebSocket client: `std.http.Client` cannot
// upgrade, and `grep -ril websocket std/` finds nothing outside
// `std.Build`'s own HTTP server. So the port does what the Python did
// and speaks RFC 6455 by hand over a raw TCP stream —
// `Io.net.IpAddress.connect(...)` returns an `Io.net.Stream`, whose
// `Stream.reader(io, buffer)` / `Stream.writer(io, buffer)` expose the
// same `Io.Reader` / `Io.Writer` interfaces the SSE suite uses. Every
// byte on the wire is therefore the byte the Python sent: the same
// handshake request line, the same header set, the same 4-byte mask on
// every client frame (a server MUST reject unmasked client frames, so
// this is the part most worth exercising), the same opcodes.
//
// Three Zig-specific hazards this file is written around:
//
//  1. `Io.Reader.take(n)` REBASES into a fixed buffer and ASSERTS when
//     `n` exceeds it. So a frame is read length-first: two header
//     bytes, then the extended-length bytes, and only then the payload
//     — with an explicit capacity check, rather than "read whatever
//     arrives" as `readVec` allows. The server caps PTY frames at
//     16 KiB (`out_frame_chunk` in terminal_ws.zig) and the reader
//     buffer is 128 KiB, so the check never fires in practice; it is
//     there so a hostile or broken length fails loudly.
//
//  2. A blocking socket read cannot be interrupted from another thread
//     in Zig — there is no `settimeout`. The only way to make one
//     returnable is to `shutdown(SHUT_RD)` it, which makes the pending
//     `readv` return 0. `ReadDeadline` is that watchdog: Python's
//     `sock.settimeout(...)` / `read_frame(deadline_s=...)`, expressed
//     as a thread that sleeps until the deadline and then shuts the
//     read side down. It is joined on every path, before the socket is
//     closed.
//
//  3. The `Sec-WebSocket-Key` and every client frame mask must be
//     UNPREDICTABLE (RFC 6455 §5.3: the mask exists to defeat cache
//     poisoning by an intermediary). A counter would satisfy the
//     format and defeat the purpose, so both come from a PRNG seeded
//     from the OS clock and the stack address — the same seeding the
//     harness's own `entropyPrng` uses.
