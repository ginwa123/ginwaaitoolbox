//! Wire test: an anthropic-style CHAT turn sends `x-api-key` +
//! `anthropic-version` (and `x-opencode-session`), not Bearer.
//!
//! Regression for the follow-up to the Test-button fix (PR #542): the
//! probe worked ("Connected — ok") but a real chat turn against
//! `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/messages` failed with
//! `StreamInterrupted (callDynamicAgentNew)` ... `{"type":"error",
//! "error":{"type":"AuthError","message":"Missing API key."}}`.
//! `Agent.callStreaming` sent only `Authorization: Bearer`, which
//! Anthropic-style upstreams ignore.
//!
//! Zig port of `tests/functional/anthropic_chat_headers_test.py` (same
//! test name, same order).
//!
//! Plan: boot the harness, PUT an anthropic profile pointing at a stub
//! SSE server, POST /api/llm/session with a queue_message (the exact
//! `sendChatMessage` wire), poll until the assistant reply lands, then
//! assert EVERY stub request carried the Anthropic auth headers.
//!
//! Run:
//!     PABRIK_BIN=<worktree>/zig-out/bin/pabrikcore-linux-x86_64 \
//!       zig test tests/functional/anthropic_chat_headers_test.zig
//!
//! THE STUB UPSTREAM
//! -----------------
//! Python ran a `ThreadingHTTPServer` bound to `127.0.0.1:0` in a
//! daemon thread, appending `{headers, body}` per POST under a
//! `threading.Lock`. The port had to be discovered from
//! `server.server_address[1]`.
//!
//! Zig's `Io.net` has no getsockname — `Server` exposes only the
//! `Socket`, and the bound port is not readable back — so the port is
//! picked the way the harness picks one for the child
//! (`findFreePortRandom` + probe) and then bound. The same race the
//! harness already accepts between its own probe and the child's bind.
//!
//! Shutdown needs one non-obvious step. `Server.accept` is a BLOCKING
//! `accept4(2)`, and on Linux closing a listening socket does NOT wake
//! a thread already blocked in `accept` on it; leaving it blocked would
//! leave an unjoined `std.Thread` alive at test end, which the
//! DebugAllocator reports as a leak. So `stopStub` sets the stop flag
//! and then makes ONE throwaway self-connect to the listener: the
//! pending connection is what `accept` returns, the loop re-reads the
//! flag, and the thread exits. If that connect fails, the listener is
//! already gone and `accept` has returned an error, so the loop has
//! exited anyway — both branches converge.
