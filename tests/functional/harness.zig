//! Functional test harness for pabrik — Zig port of `tests/functional/harness.py`.
//!
//! Boots a real `pabrik` binary against an isolated tmpdir HOME and
//! provides a typed HTTP client for the API. Every byte of state (DB,
//! config, design files, attachments) lives under the tempdir allocated
//! at boot; teardown deletes that tempdir, never anything else.
//!
//! ⛔  SAFETY INVARIANTS — DO NOT WEAKEN WITHOUT REVIEW  ⛔
//!
//! 1. `isSafeTmp(path, orig_home)` is the SINGLE source of truth for
//!    "may this path be deleted by the harness". Every recursive
//!    delete MUST be gated by it. There is no second code path.
//!
//! 2. The harness NEVER reads the ambient `HOME` inside teardown. It
//!    uses the captured `temp_dir` field, which is set once at boot and
//!    not subject to mid-test mutation.
//!
//! 3. The harness NEVER uses `~`, expanduser, or relative paths for
//!    anything it deletes. All paths are absolute and captured.
//!
//! 4. If `isSafeTmp` returns false, teardown ERRORS instead of
//!    deleting. The tempdir is leaked; the developer's home is never
//!    touched. This is the correct trade-off.
//!
//! 5. `orig_home` is captured BEFORE the child env shadows `HOME` and
//!    restored as the first step of teardown.
//!
//! 6. `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` / `XDG_STATE_HOME` / `XDG_DATA_HOME` /
//!    `XDG_CACHE_HOME` (plus `USERPROFILE` / `APPDATA` /
//!    `LOCALAPPDATA` on Windows) are shadowed in the CHILD env on every
//!    platform. On Linux `getDefaultConfigDir` resolves
//!    `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pabrik` BEFORE `$HOME/.config/pabrik`, so a
//!    child that inherited the runner's real `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` would
//!    write config.json into the real home while every test reads
//!    `<temp_dir>/.config`.
//!
//! The negative tests in `harness_safety_test.zig` guard these
//! invariants against regression.
