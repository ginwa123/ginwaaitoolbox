"""The tool set a freshly-created agent / kanban item is seeded with.

One copy, because there used to be four. `agent_tools_toggle_test`,
`agent_tools_defaults_test`, `command_tool_test` and an inline literal in
`agent_kanbans_test` each carried their own transcription of the same
26-name list. PR #744 added `add_document` + `edit_document` to
`DEFAULT_AGENT_TOOLS` and updated none of them, so the next
`zig build functional-test-all` failed 18 tests that were all really one
assertion — and a reviewer reading the CI log had to diff four files to
find that out.

The backend's list is `DEFAULT_AGENT_TOOLS`, plus `DEFAULT_KANBAN_TOOLS`
for kanban items — `src/agentic_loop/tools_equipped.zig`. Both are seeded
once at creation by `workspace_items_create_agent.zig` /
`workspace_items_create_kanban.zig`; nothing backfills them on read, so a
fresh item is the only place this is observable.

WHEN YOU ADD A TOOL TO `DEFAULT_AGENT_TOOLS`: add it here too, in sorted
order. The assertions that consume these lists are exact-equality, which
is the point — the set of tools a new agent is born with IS the contract.
A stale entry here is a red build that names the one file to edit.
