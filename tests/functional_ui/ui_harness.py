"""UI test harness — boots a pabrik backend + Vite dev server for Playwright.

Extends the existing ``FunctionalHarness`` boot story by ALSO spawning a
Vite dev server that:

  - Serves the Vue app from ``src/apps/desktop/``.
  - Proxies ``/api/*`` to the harness's chosen backend port (via the
    ``VITE_API_PROXY_TARGET`` env var, which ``src/apps/desktop/vite.config.ts``
    reads). This is what makes the test isolated: the running web app
    talks to the fixture's backend, not to the developer's always-on :8081.
  - Runs on its own free port — picked RANDOMLY from the wide shared
    range ``[20000, 32000]`` (see ``RANDOM_PORT_START`/`_END` and the
    ephemeral-range note in ``find_free_port_random`` in
    ``harness.py``). Skips Vite's default ``5173`` and the dev
    backend ``8081`` via the reserved-port list. Random selection
    avoids the CI pathology where the previous narrow sequential
    scan (5180..5299) was consumed across rapid test runs.

⛔  SAFETY INVARIANTS — INHERITED + EXTENDED  ⛔

The UI harness inherits ALL safety invariants from ``FunctionalHarness``:
``is_safe_tmp``, captured ``temp_dir``, ``ORIG_HOME`` snapshot, etc. The
new dimension is the **Vite process**.

1. ``UIHarness.teardown()`` stops Vite FIRST, then the backend, then
   rmtree's the tempdir. The order matters: if we killed the backend
   first, Vite's HTTP requests would 502 mid-shutdown and could leak
   dangling connections.

2. Vite is spawned with ``start_new_session=True`` so a single
   ``killpg(SIGTERM)`` kills the whole group (vite + esbuild + rollup
   children). Same pattern as the backend.

3. Vite logs go to ``temp_dir/vite.log`` (the same tempdir the backend's
   logs land in). Teardown rmtree's both via the existing
   ``FunctionalHarness.teardown()`` path.

4. Vite's own HOME / data dir is NOT shadowed — vite doesn't write to
   ``~/.cache`` or anything user-specific. We only shadow HOME for the
   backend; the frontend is stateless from a data perspective.

5. **Cross-platform isolation** (macOS, Linux, Windows):
   - **pnpm resolution** (2026-08-28 — pnpm migration): ``shutil.which('pnpm')``
     falls back to ``shutil.which('pnpm.cmd')`` for Windows, where
     ``pnpm`` is a batch script and ``subprocess.Popen(['pnpm', ...])``
     would otherwise fail with ``FileNotFoundError``. Previously this
     resolved ``npm``; npm was replaced by pnpm as the project's
     package manager (see the workspace ``.npmrc``).
   - **Vite signal handling**: POSIX uses ``os.killpg(SIGTERM)`` to
     signal the whole process group; Windows falls back to ``os.kill``
     (which calls ``TerminateProcess``).
   - **Source path resolution**: ``Path`` objects work cross-platform;
     the ``cwd=`` argument to ``subprocess.Popen`` accepts both
     ``/`` and ``\\`` separators.
   - **Tempdir safety**: inherited from ``FunctionalHarness.teardown``
     which now handles Windows paths via ``tempfile.gettempdir()``
     (the parent fix in 2026-08-21 makes ``is_safe_tmp`` cross-platform
     by using native backslashes on Windows).

6. **The UI harness NEVER calls ``shutil.rmtree`` itself.** All rmtree
   goes through ``FunctionalHarness.teardown`` which is gated by
   ``is_safe_tmp``. This is the single source of truth for "may this
   path be deleted" — same as the parent harness.

    with UIHarness.boot() as h:

    Strategy: random selection from the shared ``harness.RANDOM_PORT_*``
    range (re-exported as ``VITE_PORT_START`` / ``VITE_PORT_END``).
    Avoids the two CI pathologies the previous sequential scan suffered
    from:

      1. **Sequential consumption** — every UI test boot incremented
         the port, so a long suite filled the legacy 5180..5299 window
         (Vite scans the legacy range sequentially too — see the CI
         log from the bug: vite tried 5173..5188 then landed on 5189
         because the prior 5173-5188 ports were held by something).
      2. **Vite ignores --port** — vite 8 silently drops ``--port`` /
         ``--strictPort`` if pnpm forwards the argv with a literal
         ``--`` separator (see the spawn site above for the fix).
         Combined with the narrow sequential scan, this caused
         repeated test failures on shared CI runners.

    Random pick from 12k ports with 50 attempts is collision-proof
    for any realistic host occupancy. Vite-specific reserved ports
    (``5173, 8081``) are excluded via ``reserved=`` so the picker
    never lands on Vite's default or the dev backend.

    If ``suggested`` is provided (e.g. for deterministic debugging),
    use it iff it's free.
