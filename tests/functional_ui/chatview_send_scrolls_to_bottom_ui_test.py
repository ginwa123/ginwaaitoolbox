"""Functional UI test: sending a message takes the transcript to the bottom.

The report, verbatim:

    "after send or quueue message it should automatically go to bottom"

Why a real browser is the only place this can be proven
    The whole auto-stick is gated on one boolean, `isAtBottom`, and a reader
    who has scrolled up to read history is `false` by definition. A send has to
    RE-ARM that boolean, and the pre-fix code did not: it called
    `scrollToBottom(true, …)`, which writes `container.scrollTop` and leaves the
    flag to whatever the browser reports afterwards. jsdom has no layout and no
    `scroll` event on `scrollTop` writes, so a unit test can neither reproduce
    that nor observe the consequence. Here the scroll is real, the geometry is
    real, and the turn the server echoes back is real.

The hard gate
    The assertion is made against the bottom measured AFTER the sent turn has
    landed, not the bottom that existed when the button was pressed. A pin that
    aims at the pre-send bottom passes a "did you scroll down?" check and still
    leaves the turn the reader just asked for one screen below the fold — which
    is the reported symptom.

    The observable for the flag itself is the floating jump-to-bottom arrow
    (`.chat-scroll-to-bottom`), which ChatView renders under
    `v-if="!isAtBottom && messageGroups.length > 0"`. Arrow gone == the stick is
    armed. That is a stronger statement than a scroll position: it is the state
    the follow gates read.

    Also asserted: the turn that was sent is actually ON SCREEN (its row is
    inside the viewport), not merely that the scroller moved.

What this does NOT prove
    HONEST SCOPE, read this before trusting a green run as "the bug is dead".

    1. Both tests here PASS on the pre-fix build. In a real browser the
       pre-fix `scrollToBottom(true, …)` does move the scroller, and the native
       `scroll` event that follows does flip `isAtBottom`. The failure the fix
       removes is the one this harness cannot stage: a scroll write that is a
       no-op (so no event, so no flag), and `isPreservingScroll` swallowing the
       pin during a lazy-load prepend with nothing scheduled to retry it. Both
       are real; neither is reachable from Playwright against a live server.

    2. The QUEUE half of the report is not covered here. Queueing needs a live
       worker — the server parks a turn in `session_queue_messages` only when
       one is already running — and the harness's stub LLM profile points at a
       dead port, so a run dies instantly and every turn ends up RUNNING
       instead of QUEUED. Holding a worker open needs a live LLM endpoint, and
       pabrik reads its profile at boot, so it cannot be swapped in from a
       fixture. The queue path is covered instead by
       `src/apps/desktop/src/__tests__/ChatView.sendScrollsToBottom.spec.ts`
       (which pins the `queue_queued` branch to the same re-arm the send uses)
       and by `ChatScrollPolicyTest.aQueuedTurnFollowsTheTranscriptWhenTheWorkerDrainsIt`
       on Android.

    What IS proved here: the behaviour the user reported, end to end, in a real
    browser against a real backend — send from up in the history, and the turn
    lands where they can see it.

Run (the frontend is served from THIS worktree — that is the code under test;
the backend binary can come from anywhere, since no backend code changed):

    zig build
    PABRIK_BIN=./zig-out/bin/pabrikcore-linux-x86_64 \\
        python3 -m pytest tests/functional_ui/chatview_send_scrolls_to_bottom_ui_test.py -v

Environment notes found the hard way here, both pre-existing and both the
reason `chatview_ui_test.py` is red on a clean tree:

  * The chat only opens at `/app/<workspace_id>/chat/<session_id>`. The
    `/app?view=chat&session=…` shape used by `chatview_ui_test.py` needs a
    workspace already in context and otherwise lands on the home screen, where
    every geometry assertion would be about the wrong scroller.
  * `page.add_init_script` is a no-op in this Playwright build, so request
    interception has to be installed with `page.evaluate` after navigation.

Ports: the UI harness reserves (5173, 8081) and picks the backend port from
[20000, 32000]. NEVER 8081 — a dev server runs there.
