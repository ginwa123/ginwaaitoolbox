"""Functional UI test: the at-bottom stick stays armed for the whole session.

The report, verbatim:

    "auto scroll bottom if it already reached bottom, but the issues now its,
     sometimes not autoscroll bottom"

What was wrong
    ChatView and VirtualScroller each had their own idea of "the bottom":

      * `VirtualScroller.scrollToBottom` parks the reader on the REAL content
        bottom — `topSpacer + content.offsetHeight` — whenever the height model
        overshoots by more than its hysteresis. That is the blank-viewport fix:
        the sizer is a height MODEL, and trusting it can strand the reader in a
        fully blank region.
      * ChatView decided at-bottom with the DOM's ruler, `scrollHeight -
        clientHeight`, against a 10px tolerance.

    With the tail cap latched (`maxTailGap`, 100px by default) the two disagree
    by the overshoot. So a *successful* auto-stick produced the scroll event
    that immediately said "the user left the bottom", and all four gates that
    read that flag — the conditional `scrollToBottom`, the `contentShift`
    re-stick, the SSE-chunk remeasure and the messages-length watcher — went
    quiet for the rest of the mount. The chat simply stopped following the
    stream, and the jump-to-bottom arrow appeared while the reader sat on the
    last message. Hence "sometimes": it needs the tail cap latched, i.e. a long
    chat whose tail rows are shorter than the running median.

Why a real browser is the only place this can be proven
    The defect is entirely about AGREEMENT BETWEEN TWO RULERS on real measured
    geometry. jsdom has no layout, so `scrollHeight`, `offsetHeight` and the
    `translate3d` on the content window are all zeros there — the two rulers
    are identical and the bug is invisible by construction. Here the sizer
    really does overshoot a short tail, and both numbers are readable.

The two observables
    1. `.chat-scroll-to-bottom` — rendered under `v-if="!isAtBottom && …"`, so
       its ABSENCE is the flag every follow gate reads. This is the primary
       assertion: a scroll position can look right while the app believes the
       reader walked away, and that is precisely the bug.
    2. The app's own ruler, recomputed in the page from the same DOM nodes the
       scroller reads (`topSpacer` from the content transform + the rendered
       rows' real heights). Asserting `scrollTop` against `scrollHeight` — as
       the older send-scroll test does with `BOTTOM_TOL_PX = 24` — measures the
       BUG, not the behaviour: a correct stick sits up to `maxTailGap` above
       the DOM max on purpose.

Run (the frontend is served from THIS worktree — that is the code under test;
the backend binary can come from anywhere, since no backend code changed):

    zig build
    NALAR_BIN=./zig-out/bin/nalarcore-linux-x86_64 \\
        python3 -m pytest tests/functional_ui/chatview_at_bottom_stick_ui_test.py -v

Ports: the UI harness reserves (5173, 8081) and picks both the backend and the
Vite port from [20000, 32000]. NEVER 8081 — a dev server runs there.

    """The anchor-compensation jump — the defect this test was an xfail for.

    This WAS a `strict=False` xfail: a large remeasure yanked an at-bottom
    reader ~15.9k px up with NO content change (scrollHeight 96873 -> 96868)
    while the rendered window expanded from 34 to 66 rows, and the stick then
    read the displaced reader as deliberately scrolled up. The marker said to
    delete it when the compensation was fixed — that is what happened, in
    `VirtualScroller.measureItems` (an at-bottom reader is re-targeted at the
    bottom edge instead of compensated around the anchor) plus the stale
    tail-cap fix in `recordTailContentBottom`. So this is now a real assertion:
    if the fix regresses, the xfail is gone and the test goes red.

    Root cause in one line: the anchor's job is to hold still whatever the
    reader is looking at, and a reader at the bottom has no view to preserve —
    the content they are reading is what the pass just resized. So the pass
    preserved a position they never chose, thousands of pixels above the
    newest content, and ChatView's `isAtBottom` correctly reported the position
    the scroller had put them in.

    The signature to look for if it ever regresses: `scrollTop` drops by
    thousands of px while `scrollHeight` is unchanged, and `rendered` jumps.
    That combination means a viewport write with no content cause — the
    scroller moved the reader, not the transcript.

    The sequence matters, and getting it wrong passes: the jump only happens
    after the reader has been UP the history and returned via the
    jump-to-bottom button, i.e. once the height model has been corrected for a
    window that was not the tail. A stream on a freshly-opened chat does not
    reproduce it.
