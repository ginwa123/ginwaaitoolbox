"""Safety tests for the UIHarness.

These tests run WITHOUT a nalar binary or a Vite dev server. They
assert the safety invariants in ``ui_harness.py`` — the guards that
prevent the harness from ever deleting the developer's real $HOME,
on macOS, Linux, AND Windows.

If any of these tests fail, the harness has a P0 bug. Do not merge
until they pass.

The tests are deliberately cross-platform: they use ``os.path.normpath``
to construct the expected paths, so the same test passes on every OS.
