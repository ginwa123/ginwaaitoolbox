"""End-to-end smoke test for the UIHarness.

Boots a real nalar backend + Vite dev server against an isolated
tmpdir HOME, then opens the running web app in a headless Chromium
browser and verifies (a) the Vue app mounts, (b) the API proxy
works (a request to /api/* via the browser reaches the test backend,
not the developer's :8081).

This is the FIRST test that requires both a built nalar binary AND
installed Playwright browsers. Run:

    # One-time setup (downloads ~150 MB of browser binaries):
    pip install playwright
    playwright install chromium

    # Run the smoke test:
    NALAR_BIN=/path/to/nalar pytest tests/functional_ui/smoke_boot_test.py -v
