"""The document viewer COVERS the chat it was opened from.

Repro: click a session in the RECENT list, then click a document. The URL
becomes `/app/<ws>/chat/<session>?doc=<id>`, which mounts the ChatView AND
the DocumentsView overlay at the same time. The document is meant to cover
the chat (it is an `absolute inset-0` overlay inside the same `<main>`), but
the chat's floating chrome painted ON TOP of it: the composer dock, the
scroll-to-bottom arrow and the scroll slider were all visible over the
document body, which made the viewer look broken.

The cause was a missing stacking context, and the whole reason this is a
browser test: `main` and `.chat-column` are both `position: relative` with
`z-index: auto`, which does NOT open a stacking context. So the chat's
z-ladder (scroll slider / pill rail 20, composer dock 30, scroll-to-bottom
31) and the document overlay's `z-index: 10` were all compared in the ROOT
stacking context, where every chat tier outranks 10 and wins. jsdom has no
layout engine and does not apply SFC `<style>` blocks, so it can see
neither the computed `isolation` nor the resulting paint order — both halves
of this contract are invisible to the unit suite.

What is asserted here, by `elementFromPoint` (hit-testing walks the same
stacking order that painting does, so the returned element is the one the
user actually sees):

  1. `elementFromPoint` at the centre of the composer card, the
     scroll-to-bottom arrow and the scroll slider all land INSIDE the
     document overlay — i.e. the document, not the chat, is on top;
  2. `.chat-column` actually computes `isolation: isolate`, so the
     containment is real rather than an accidental z-index coincidence;
  3. the chat is still MOUNTED underneath, because the overlay is
     deliberately an overlay — that is what keeps a Back/Forward or a
     document switch instant. If the chat were simply unmounted, the paint
     order would look right while the behaviour regressed.

The unit half of the contract lives in
`src/apps/desktop/src/__tests__/ChatView.stackingContainment.spec.ts`.
