"""Functional UI test: older-history PREFETCH fires before the scroll reaches the top.

Task_1789505423062_0 — the user's complaint, verbatim:

    "the issues auto scroll is loaded after the user hit the max, but what if
     the auto fetch is do before scroll reach the top"

What the feature does (see ChatView.vue "Older-history pagination"):
a predictive ARM fetches the next older page into an in-memory buffer while
the user is still travelling, and crossing the scroller's load-more band
COMMITS that buffered page through the existing preserve path — so the round
trip is off the critical path.

Why a real browser is required
    The claim is about a WIRE round trip racing a MOMENTUM SCROLL. Neither can
    be reproduced in jsdom (no layout, no coalesced scroll events, and jsdom
    does not fire `scroll` on `scrollTop` writes). This test boots a real
    `nalar` backend + a real Vite dev server + headless Chromium and drives a
    synthetic fling with `requestAnimationFrame`.

The hard gate (assertion that FAILS on the pre-fix build)
    The scroll-back request must be issued while the container is still OUTSIDE
    its load-more band (`scrollTop > max(200, 0.5 × clientHeight)`) — not after
    the user is pinned at `scrollTop == 0`. Pre-fix, `VirtualScroller.onScroll`'s
    trailing-edge 200 ms debounce (reset on every scroll event) means the
    request is only issued after the fling SETTLES at the top, so this assertion
    fails structurally — it measures the bug, not the implementation.

Also asserted: no scroll-back request is issued on open; exactly ONE request
per exhausted page (the commit comes from the buffer, not a fresh request);
no two requests share a cursor; the prepend grows the content without
duplicating rendered groups and without moving the reading anchor.

Run (binary must be built first — a fresh worktree has no `zig-out/`):
    zig build
    NALAR_BIN=./zig-out/bin/nalarcore-linux-x86_64 \\
        python3 -m pytest tests/functional_ui/chatview_lazy_prefetch_ui_test.py -v

Control run (proves the gate measures the fix) — same command against `main`,
assertion 1 must FAIL.

Ports: the UI harness reserves (5173, 8081) and picks the backend port from
[40000, 60000]. NEVER 8081 (a dev server runs there).
