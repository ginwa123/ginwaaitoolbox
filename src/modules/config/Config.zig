/// spent and no eval can start until the user opts in.

/// Why a flag rather than just "the tool is absent by default": the tool list
/// is seeded per workspace item at creation time, so an existing install would
/// otherwise never see the feature appear (or disappear) when the user changes

/// byte-identical across agents and remains one cache hit rather than N
/// fragments (see the comment in
