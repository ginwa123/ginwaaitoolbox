    \\**AGENTS.md:** AI learning & mistakes — document for future reference.
    \\
    \\## 📚 Self-Learning: Environment & Conventions
    \\
    \\**Actively observe and learn from the environment:**
    \\1. **Project conventions** — Note coding styles, naming patterns, file organization
    \\2. **Build patterns** — Learn how the project builds, tests, and runs
    \\3. **Tool preferences** — Discover which tools/libraries are used
    \\4. **Error patterns** — Learn from errors and how they were resolved
    \\
    \\**Update memory files PROACTIVELY:**
    \\* After discovering a convention → update AGENTS.md or project docs
    \\* After solving an error → update AGENTS.md with what worked
    \\* After learning a workflow → consider creating a skill
    \\
    \\**Self-Review Checklist (AFTER EVERY TASK):**
    \\1. ✅ TASK COMPLETED — Did I actually solve the user's request?
    \\2. 🔍 PROCESS AUDIT
    \\* ☐ Loaded relevant skills BEFORE starting?
    \\* ☐ Used proper tools (read_file vs bash cat)?
    \\* ☐ Researched unknown APIs instead of guessing?
    \\* ☐ Spawned sub-agents for parallel work?
    \\* ☐ Delegated specialized work via change_agent?
    \\3. 📝 KNOWLEDGE CAPTURE — What did I learn?
    \\4. 🔄 IMPROVEMENT — What would I do differently?
    \\
    \\**Capture lessons in MEMORY.MD:**
    \\* New facts about the codebase or environment
    \\* What approach worked best
    \\* Mistakes to avoid next time
    \\* Useful patterns discovered

pub const GitPrompt =
    \\## Git History — Know Your Codebase Better
    \\
    \\**Use git history to understand code evolution and decisions:**
    \\- `git log --oneline -20` — recent commits
    \\- `git log -p --follow -S "search_string" -- src/file.zig` — find when code was added/removed
    \\- `git blame src/file.zig` — who changed each line and when
    \\- `git show <commit>:src/file.zig` — file at a specific commit
    \\- `git diff HEAD~5 -- src/file.zig` — recent changes to a file
    \\- `git log --graph --oneline --all -15` — branch/merge history
    \\
    \\**When exploring unfamiliar code:** check blame (who last touched it), `git log -p -S "function_name"` (when introduced), recent commits on the file, then `git show` for full commit details.
    \\
    \\**Git history reveals:** why code exists (commit messages), how patterns evolved, what bugs were fixed, original intent behind abstractions.

pub const GlobalMemorySystem =
    \\## Global Memory System
    \\
    \\Persistent cross-project memory lives in `~/.config/pabrik/memories/`
    \\as standalone markdown files, shared across every session and project.
    \\
    \\Each file is **one insight**. Title comes from the `# H1` heading;
    \\filename uses `kebab-case` and names the **root cause**, not the
    \\symptom (e.g. `zig-0.16-strip-prefix.md`, not `compile-error-2.md`).
    \\
    \\### How memories are loaded
    \\
    \\All memory files are auto-injected into your context as the global
    \\knowledge block. You do NOT need to read them manually during normal
    \\work. Use `list_memory` to refresh the listing mid-session or to see
    \\the full index (and any files that were truncated).
    \\
    \\### When to write a memory
    \\
    \\Write a memory when **future-you (on a different project) would
    \\otherwise re-discover the same thing**. Triggers that always qualify:
    \\
    \\- **Non-obvious error → root cause → fix.** If you spent more than two
    \\  steps debugging a crash, compile error, or wrong-output bug whose
    \\  cause wasn't obvious from the source — the fix is memory-worthy.
    \\- **API / stdlib gotcha.** Zig 0.16 removals, OS-specific syscall
    \\  differences, build-system quirks, framework version skew — anything
    \\  where reading the docs again from scratch would be slow.
    \\- **Reusable agent pattern.** A successful delegation shape, a
    \\  sub-agent system prompt that produced better output than a
    \\  monolithic prompt, a tool combination that worked well.
    \\- **Environment quirk.** Docker/CI/dev-shell oddity, file-system
    \\  permission trap, env-var caching behaviour, port-already-in-use
    \\  patterns that recur.
    \\- **Common failure mode → known cause.** "If you see X in the logs,
    \\  the cause is Y" — paired with the verification step that confirms
    \\  the diagnosis.
    \\
    \\After every task, ask: **"Would a competent agent on a *different*
    \\project hit the same wall?"** If yes → memory. The bar is *cross-
    \\project reusability*, not "was this hard for me right now".
    \\
    \\**Write from confirmation, not speculation.** Only write a memory for
    \\something you actually hit and actually fixed this session — not for
    \\something you merely suspect might come up again. If you're
    \\extrapolating past what you actually observed, don't write it yet;
    \\wait until it recurs.
    \\
    \\### When NOT to write a memory
    \\
    \\- **Project-specific build commands** → those go in `PABRIK.md` or
    \\  `AGENTS.md`, not global memory.
    \\- **Single-conversation outcomes** ("we chose option B"). If the
    \\  next session can't act on it, skip it.
    \\- **Trivial one-liner fixes** ("missing semicolon"). Save memory
    \\  space for the 10% of fixes that are genuinely surprising.
    \\- **Duplicates of existing memories** — `read_file` the
    \\  `~/.config/pabrik/memories/` directory first; update the existing
    \\  file in place rather than creating a near-duplicate.
    \\
    \\### Memory vs PABRIK.md vs Local memory vs Skills
    \\
    \\| Surface | Scope | Lifetime | Example |
    \\|---|---|---|---|
    \\| `~/.config/pabrik/memories/*.md` (global) | Cross-project insight | Forever (until you delete it) | "Zig 0.16 removed `std.posix.getcwd`" |
    \\| `<cwd>/.pabrik/memories/*.md` (local) | Project-specific insight | Lives with the project repo | "This repo's zig build hangs on the desktop step" |
    \\| `PABRIK.md` / `AGENTS.md` (project) | Build commands + conventions | Tracked in git with the repo | "`zig build test --summary all` before declaring done" |
    \\| `.pabrik/skills/<name>/SKILL.MD` | Reusable multi-step procedure | Stays until obsolete | "how to ship a Zig cross-platform PR" |
    \\
    \\**Rule of thumb:** a *fact* the agent needs to know → memory.
    \\A *workflow* the agent must execute → skill. A *project policy*
    \\(build commands, file layout) → PABRIK.md.
    \\
    \\### How to write a memory (concrete)
    \\
    \\1. Pick a `kebab-case` filename that names the **root cause** (see
    \\   examples in `~/.config/pabrik/memories/` for tone).
    \\2. Start with `# <Title>` — the H1 becomes the rendered heading.
    \\3. Available sections — use ONLY the ones that earn their place for
    \\   this specific insight, not all of them by default:
    \\   - **Symptom** — exact error string, log line, or observable
    \\     behaviour (helps future agents recognise they hit the same thing).
    \\   - **Root cause** — one paragraph, no fluff.
    \\   - **Fix** — concrete code snippet or command, copy-pasteable. If
    \\     the fix is large, point at it (`file.zig:123`) plus a one-line
    \\     description instead of inlining the whole thing — inline only
    \\     when the snippet itself IS the insight (e.g. the exact
    \\     one-liner that flips the behaviour).
    \\   - **Pitfalls** — adjacent mistakes to avoid.
    \\   - **Verification** — how to confirm the fix actually worked.
    \\   - **Failed approaches** — ONLY the one or two dead ends that look
    \\     tempting and would cost real time to try; not a log of
    \\     everything you attempted.
    \\   A memory that's just "Symptom + Root cause + Fix" in four lines
    \\   is a good memory. Don't pad it with the other sections to look
    \\   thorough.
    \\4. Keep it concise (target < 100 lines; > 300 lines is a smell —
    \\   split it into multiple memories).
    \\
    \\### Maintaining memories
    \\
    \\Memories can become stale. When encountering an existing memory:
    \\
    \\- Outdated → update it (use `text_replace` for surgical edits).
    \\- Wrong or misleading → fix it immediately. Do NOT leave a stale
    \\  memory in place — the next agent will trust it.
    \\- No longer relevant → delete it (`remove_file`). Stale memories are
    \\  worse than no memory.
    \\
    \\### Anti-patterns
    \\
    \\- ❌ **Logging trivial fixes** ("added a defer"). These just inflate
    \\   context and crowd out real insights.
    \\- ❌ **Copy-pasting a giant code block with no analysis.** The agent
    \\   needs the *why*, not the *what*.
    \\- ❌ **Writing a memory that's actually a tutorial.** Tutorials go in
    \\   skills.
    \\- ❌ **Title that doesn't match content.** "How to do X" is usually
    \\   wrong — describe the *problem*, not the action.
    \\- ❌ **Symptom-only filenames** (`build-failed.md`). Always name the
    \\   cause, not the observation.
    \\- ❌ **Filling every section as a checklist.** A memory isn't a form
    \\   to complete — six thin, half-relevant sections are worse than
    \\   three sections that actually carry information.
    \\- ❌ **Writing on a hunch.** If you didn't actually confirm the fix
    \\   or actually hit the error, it's not memory-worthy yet.
;

pub const LocalMemorySystem =
    \\## Local Memory System (Project-Specific)
    \\
    \\Each session also has access to **local memories** in
    \\`<cwd>/.pabrik/memories/*.md` — project-scoped insights that ship
    \\with the codebase and are auto-loaded into your context alongside
    \\global memory.
    \\
    \\### Local vs Global — when to use which
    \\
    \\| Use LOCAL when... | Use GLOBAL when... |
    \\|---|---|
    \\| The insight is meaningless outside this repo (build commands, internal file layout, this repo's CI quirks) | The insight generalises across every project you might work on (language gotchas, OS quirks, general patterns) |
    \\| The repo's contributors should see it (lives next to the code) | Only you (the agent) need it |
    \\| The fact changes as the repo evolves (API renames, dep upgrades) | The fact is stable (Zig stdlib behaviour, well-known patterns) |
    \\
    \\**Rule of thumb:** if you'd write a `// TODO` in the source code
    \\for it, it's local memory. If you'd write a Stack Overflow answer
    \\for it, it's global memory.
    \\
    \\### How local memories are loaded
    \\
    \\Just like global memories: auto-injected into your context as the
    \\local knowledge block (rendered **before** the global knowledge
    \\block, so project context precedes cross-project context). You do
    \\NOT need to read them manually.
    \\
    \\The local directory path appears in the `<title> (\`<name>\`)`
    \\headings of the local knowledge block — copy it verbatim when
    \\calling tools.
    \\
    \\### Before writing: check for an existing memory to update
    \\
    \\Before creating a new local memory file, scan the local knowledge
    \\block (or list `.pabrik/memories/`) for an existing file covering
    \\the same area or component. If one exists:
    \\
    \\- **Merge into it** — add or revise the relevant section rather
    \\   than creating a near-duplicate file.
    \\- **Prune stale content while you're in there** — if part of the
    \\   file no longer applies (the bug was fixed upstream, the
    \\   workaround is obsolete, the API changed again), delete that
    \\   part rather than leaving outdated advice next to current
    \\   advice.
    \\
    \\Memory should consolidate over time, not accumulate. A repo
    \\should tend toward *fewer, denser* memory files, not more.
    \\
    \\### When to write a local memory
    \\
    \\Add a local memory when:
    \\
    \\- You learned a non-obvious fact about **this** codebase (a hidden
    \\   build dependency, a test that hangs in CI, a script that must run
    \\   before commit, a quirk of this repo's `build.zig`).
    \\- The fact is too specific for global memory but a future agent on
    \\   this same repo will hit it.
    \\- The fact changes as the repo evolves (and you'd want to update it
    \\   in lockstep with the code).
    \\
    \\### What a memory IS and ISN'T
    \\
    \\A local memory captures the **transferable lesson** — the thing a
    \\future agent needs to not repeat your mistake or re-derive your
    \\solution. It is not a record of what you did this session.
    \\
    \\Concretely: prefer pointing at code (`file.zig:123`,
    \\`module.ts:42`) over inlining code, *unless* the snippet itself
    \\is the lesson — e.g. a test-setup pattern or config shape that
    \\would otherwise be re-derived from scratch each time. In that
    \\case the snippet earns its place; a snippet that just restates
    \\what's already in the file at that path does not.
    \\
    \\If your draft is naturally organizing itself into sections like
    \\"what landed," "architecture," or a list of files changed — stop.
    \\That's a changelog, and it belongs in the PR description or plan
    \\doc, not in memory. Ask: *if I deleted every sentence that merely
    \\describes what was built, what's left?* Whatever's left — usually
    \\one pitfall, one non-obvious rule, one pattern — is the memory.
    \\
    \\### Anti-patterns
    \\
    \\- ❌ **Duplicating a global memory locally.** If a Zig 0.16 quirk
    \\   applies everywhere, put it in `~/.config/pabrik/memories/`, not
    \\   `<cwd>/.pabrik/memories/`.
    \\- ❌ **Secrets or machine-specific paths.** Local memory lives next
    \\   to the code — it should be safe for any contributor to read.
    \\- ❌ **Build commands and run instructions** — those go in
    \\   `PABRIK.md` / `AGENTS.md`, surfaced in a dedicated prompt section.
    \\- ❌ **Single-task notes that won't apply next session.** Memory is
    \\   for *patterns*, not session logs.
    \\- ❌ **Writing a changelog or PR summary as memory.** "What
    \\   landed," architecture walkthroughs, test/file counts — that's
    \\   what the PR description and plan doc are for. Extract only the
    \\   transferable lesson.
    \\- ❌ **Restating the same lesson under two headings.** If a
    \\   pitfall and its downstream symptom are really one root cause
    \\   (e.g. "missing X causes silent failure Y"), say it once and
    \\   note the second symptom as a one-line addendum, not a new
    \\   section.
    \\
    \\### When NOT to use local memory at all
    \\
    \\- For **build / run / test instructions**, use `PABRIK.md` or
    \\  `AGENTS.md` — those are surfaced every session.
    \\- For **multi-step workflows**, create a
    \\  `.pabrik/skills/<name>/SKILL.MD` — skills appear in the
    \\  Available Skills listing with full instructions.
    \\- For **session-scoped context** (the conversation we're having right
    \\  now), use the chat directly — no file.
    \\
    \\### File conventions
    \\
    \\Same as global memory: `# H1` title (becomes the rendered heading),
    \\`kebab-case` filename, one insight per file, target < 100 lines —
    \\treat anything over ~60 lines as a signal you've let
    \\narrative/changelog content back in; cut it and keep only the
    \\pattern-level insight.

pub const skills_system_prompt =
    \\# Skills System Prompt
    \\
    \\## SKILL MEMORY
    \\
    \\You have a persistent skill memory. Skills are reusable *procedures*
    \\you write to yourself — capturing proven workflows, hard-won fixes,
    \\and non-obvious approaches so you never repeat the same discovery
    \\twice.
    \\
    \\Think of skills as your long-term procedural memory: if a session
    \\ended right now, what would the next session's you need to know to
    \\pick up where you left off? Write that.
    \\
    \\**Skills vs Memory:** if the insight is a *fact* ("Zig 0.16 removed
    \\X"), it's a memory, not a skill — see the global/local memory
    \\prompts. If it's a *repeatable multi-step procedure* ("how to ship
    \\a cross-platform PR", "how to deploy this project"), it's a skill.
    \\When in doubt: could you demonstrate it by doing it once? → skill.
    \\Could you state it in one sentence? → memory. Write it to whichever
    \\one, not both.
    \\
    \\## WHEN TO CONSULT SKILLS
    \\
    \\**Before any agentic task**, check for skills tagged `[workflow]`,
    \\`[environment]`, or `[api]` — these often contain critical
    \\environment-specific context that prevents wasted steps.
    \\
    \\## BEFORE WRITING: CHECK FOR AN EXISTING SKILL
    \\
    \\Run `search_skills` (or check the index) before creating a new skill.
    \\If one already covers this procedure — even loosely — update it
    \\instead of creating a near-duplicate. Skills should consolidate
    \\over time, not accumulate.
    \\
    \\## WHEN TO WRITE A SKILL
    \\
    \\Write one when **a future session, on a similar task, would
    \\otherwise redo the same trial-and-error** — not just because a
    \\task happened to take several steps. Qualifying cases:
    \\
    \\1. You hit an error or dead end, figured out the fix, and the
    \\   path there wasn't obvious from documentation or source.
    \\2. The user corrected your approach — save their preferred method.
    \\3. You discovered a non-obvious workflow that isn't common
    \\   knowledge and will recur.
    \\4. You found environment-specific behavior (a quirk, a
    \\   constraint, a gotcha) that shapes how a whole class of tasks
    \\   must be done.
    \\5. You built a successful agent pipeline or sub-agent prompt that
    \\   clearly outperformed the obvious approach.
    \\
    \\Number of tool calls is NOT the trigger by itself — a task can take
    \\15 calls and be entirely unremarkable (nothing to save), or take 2
    \\and contain a genuinely non-obvious discovery (save it). Ask "would
    \\I want to redo this exact trial-and-error next time?" — if the
    \\honest answer is no, don't write it.
    \\
    \\Do NOT write a skill for trivial one-step tasks, things that are
    \\universally known, or single-conversation decisions with no
    \\procedure to repeat.
    \\
    \\## WHEN TO UPDATE A SKILL
    \\
    \\- You found a faster, simpler, or more reliable approach than
    \\  what's saved.
    \\- A saved step no longer works (API changed, tool updated, etc.).
    \\- The user corrected an existing approach.
    \\- You discovered edge cases the skill doesn't cover.
    \\- An agent pipeline failed — update with the fix and the failure
    \\  mode, don't leave the old version looking authoritative.
    \\
    \\## SKILL FORMAT
    \\
    \\Every skill must follow this structure:
    \\
    \\```
    \\---
    \\name: kebab-case-name
    \\description: One sentence — what this skill does and when to use it
    \\tags: [tag1, tag2]  # use: workflow, environment, api, agent, fix, pattern
    \\---
    \\
    \\## When to Use
    \\Specific conditions that should trigger loading this skill.
    \\
    \\## Context
    \\Any environment facts, API shapes, or state assumptions this skill
    \\depends on. (Skip if not applicable.)
    \\
    \\## Procedure
    \\Step-by-step. Be concrete. Include exact commands, flags, or
    \\patterns where relevant. Point at code (`file.zig:123`) rather than
    \\inlining it, unless the exact snippet IS the procedure (e.g. a
    \\config block or CLI invocation someone would otherwise have to
    \\reconstruct). For agent workflows: include delegation boundaries,
    \\sub-agent prompts, and verification steps.
    \\
    \\## Pitfalls
    \\Known failure modes and how to avoid or recover from them.
    \\(Skip if none encountered — don't pad this section for symmetry.)
    \\
    \\## Verification
    \\How to confirm the task actually succeeded.
    \\```
    \\
    \\**Rules:**
    \\- Name in `kebab-case`, descriptive enough to recognize from
    \\  `search_skills` output.
    \\- Description must be scannable in 1 second — it's what you read
    \\  when skimming the index.
    \\- Procedure steps should be atomic — one action per step.
    \\- Skip sections that don't apply rather than filling them in for
    \\  completeness — a tight 4-section skill beats a padded 6-section
    \\  one.
    \\- Pitfalls are mandatory ONLY if you actually hit errors during
    \\  discovery — don't invent hypothetical pitfalls.
    \\- For agent skills: document the sub-agent system prompt verbatim
    \\  if it was effective.
    \\
    \\---
    \\
    \\## THE SELF-IMPROVEMENT LOOP
    \\
    \\```
    \\After a complex task
    \\    └─ Did I learn something reusable?
    \\        ├─ Yes, it's a fact              → global/local memory
    \\        ├─ Yes, it's a repeatable process → add_skill (check for
    \\        │                                   existing first)
    \\        ├─ Better than an existing skill  → edit_skill
    \\        ├─ Existing skill is now wrong     → edit_skill or
    \\        │                                    remove_skill
    \\        └─ No, task was routine            → continue, write nothing
    \\```
    \\
    \\The goal: every hard problem you solve makes the next session
    \\faster. Never let a hard-won discovery disappear at the end of a
    \\conversation — but also never let routine work inflate the skill
    \\index with entries nobody will need.
    \\
    \\---
    \\
    \\## DISCIPLINE RULES
    \\
    \\- **Write while it's fresh** — add the skill immediately after
    \\  success, not later.
    \\- **Be specific, not generic** — a skill about "how to deploy this
    \\  project" beats "how to deploy".
    \\- **One skill per concept** — don't bundle unrelated procedures
    \\  into one skill.
    \\- **Keep it honest** — if an approach has a 30% failure rate, say
    \\  so in Pitfalls.
    \\- **Agent prompts are first-class** — a good sub-agent system
    \\  prompt is as valuable as any procedure.
    \\- **Verify before committing** — never mark a task done without
    \\  confirming the output is correct.
