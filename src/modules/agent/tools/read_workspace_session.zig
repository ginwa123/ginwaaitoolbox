    \\## Read Workspace Session Tool — Behavior
    \\Use `read_workspace_session` to discover, search, and read OTHER chat sessions in YOUR workspace.
    \\- No args → LIST sessions in your workspace (names + previews so you can pick one).
    \\- `query` → SEARCH message content across your workspace (FTS).
    \\- `session_id` → READ that session's messages. `query` + `session_id` → SEARCH-WITHIN one session.
    \\- Scope is automatic (your workspace only). Cross-workspace reads are denied, never leaked.
    \\- Your OWN session is excluded by default in every behavior. Pass `is_current_session: true`
    \\  only when you deliberately need it (e.g. your own messages dropped by compaction).
    \\
;

pub const read_workspace_session_tool = AgentTool{
    .type = "function",
    .function = .{
        .name = "read_workspace_session",
        .description =
        \\Discover, search, and read other chat sessions in YOUR workspace — including messages compacted out of the live context. Scope is derived server-side from your session: you can only ever see sessions in your own workspace. Reads of other workspaces' sessions are denied.
        \\
        \\FOUR BEHAVIORS (pick by params):
        \\- LIST (neither `query` nor `session_id`): sessions in your workspace with name, status, message count, last activity, and a preview of the latest human message. Your own session is excluded unless `is_current_session` is true. Use this when you need to find "the conversation about X" but don't know its session id.
        \\- SEARCH (`query` only): full-text search over message content across your workspace using SQLite FTS5. Filter by `role`/`tool_name`/`parent_session_id`/`agent`, time-bound via `since`/`until`, restrict to live or compacted rows via `live_only`/`compacted_only`, paginate with `offset` + `limit`. Returns ranked matches with a preview snippet + owning session id/name. For long result sets, read <total_count> and call again with offset=N until offset + count >= total_count.
        \\- READ (`session_id` only): messages of one session in your workspace (live + compacted). Returns an index (id, role, created_at, preview); pass `message_ids` (up to 50) for full <content> bodies. Use `order="desc"` for most-recent-first, `since`/`until` to paginate forward.
        \\- SEARCH-WITHIN (both `query` and `session_id`): FTS restricted to that one session (which must be in your workspace).
        \\
        \\YOUR OWN SESSION (all four behaviors): excluded by default. LIST/SEARCH filter it out; READ/SEARCH-WITHIN aimed at it return an `error` telling you to retry. Set `is_current_session: true` to opt back in — you already hold the current session in your live context, so only ask for it deliberately (e.g. `compacted_only` to recover messages compaction dropped).
        \\
        \\FTS QUERY SANITIZATION: queries with `.`, `-`, `:`, `*`, `^`, `(`, `)`, `"`, `+` are auto-sanitized — you can write `handle_tool.zig` or `AGENTS.md` without pre-escaping. Multi-word queries are joined with FTS5 OR (`a b` matches rows containing `a` OR `b`) for natural recall.
        \\
        \\Response shape (JSON fields):
        \\- `count`: number of entries in THIS response (page size).
        \\- `total_count`: total matching entries before pagination. Use to know whether more pages exist.
        \\- per-message `content` is truncated to 16 KB; `content_truncated=true` indicates there's more. Call again with a narrower message_ids list to fetch the rest.
        \\- cross-workspace targets return `denied:true`, not content. Sessions outside your workspace are never listed, never searched, never read.
        \\
        \\Filters (optional, apply to SEARCH/READ/SEARCH-WITHIN unless noted):
        \\- role: "user", "assistant", or "tool" — exact match.
        \\- tool_name: exact-match filter on the tool that produced the row. Useful for "find every bash invocation that ran `cargo test`".
        \\- parent_session_id: exact-match filter on sub-agent sessions. Useful for tracing a sub-agent's full session.
        \\- agent: exact-match filter on the agent name (e.g. "main", "planning", "compaction").
        \\- live_only / compacted_only (mutually exclusive): restrict to messages still in your live context (is_feed_to_llm=1) vs. dropped by compaction (is_feed_to_llm=0). Default returns both.
        \\- since / until: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS inclusive bounds on created_at.
        \\- is_current_session: when true, the CURRENT session is included in the results. Default false — your own session is excluded from LIST/SEARCH and refused by READ/SEARCH-WITHIN.
        \\- limit: max rows to return (default 20, max 200; LIST max 50).
        \\- offset: SEARCH only — skip first N matches for pagination.
        \\- order: READ only — "asc" (chronological forward, default) or "desc" (most-recent-first).
        \\
