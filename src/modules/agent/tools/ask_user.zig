//! `ask_user` — an agent tool that stops the turn to ask the human a
//! question, with 2–6 selectable options and/or a free-text answer.
//!
//! ## Why the turn ends instead of blocking
//!
//! The tool returns IMMEDIATELY with a `"status":"pending"` payload.
//! `handle_tool` finishes its batch normally (Phase 1 has already given every
//! tool call its own `role=tool` row, so the message chain stays valid), and
//! the agentic loop then BREAKS instead of looping back — see
//! `src/agentic_loop/workflow.zig` (the `.tool_calls` arm) and
//! `ask_user_pending.zig`.
//!
//! Nothing is parked in memory and there is no timeout: the question is a
//! persisted row, so it can wait a minute or a week for the same cost. When
//! the human answers, `POST /api/llm/session/:id/answer` rewrites THIS tool's
//! result row in place and starts a new run, which reads the answer as a
//! normal tool result.
//!
//! ## The four exit statuses
//!
//! | status | who writes it | what the model should do |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `answered` | the answer endpoint | continue with the answer |
//! | `skipped` | the answer endpoint (`skip:true`) | do not guess; say what is blocked |
//! | `abandoned` | the `session_create` guard (the human sent a message instead) | do not guess; re-ask once if still needed |
//! | `unavailable` | this tool, immediately (sub-agent only) | decide yourself and state the assumption |
//!
//! Only *malformed input* becomes `success=false` + `<error>`; the four
//! statuses above are successful calls with a degraded outcome. That mirrors
//! the repo-wide contract (`tools_exec_create_kanban_task.zig`): `<error>`
//! means "the call was invalid", never "the outcome was negative".

    \\
    \\- Do NOT use it to confirm something you can verify yourself (read the file, run
    \\  the command, check the plan). Do NOT use it for permission you already have.
    \\- Call it ALONE — never in the same batch as another tool. Every other tool call
    \\  in the batch would be discarded anyway, because asking ends the turn.
    \\- Ask ONE question. Batch the context into `question`, not multiple calls.
    \\- Prefer `options` (2–6 short strings) over free text; set `recommended` to the
    \\  option you would pick so the human can answer in one click.
    \\- After calling it, the turn ENDS. You will be resumed with `"status":"answered"`,
    \\  `"status":"skipped"` or `"status":"abandoned"`. On `skipped`/`abandoned`, do not
    \\  guess — say what you are blocked on.

    \\  surface. Pick the most reasonable option yourself, state the assumption, and continue.

        \\- A decision is genuinely ambiguous: the repo and the conversation do not
        \\  determine which path the human wants, and guessing wrong would waste work.
        \\- You need a fact only the human has (an account id, a deployment target, a

        \\HOW IT WORKS:
        \\- The call returns immediately with `"status":"pending"` and the turn
        \\  ENDS. The human sees a question card in the transcript and answers whenever
        \\  they like — there is no timeout.
        \\- Your next turn starts with this tool's result rewritten to
        \\  `{"status":"answered","answer":"…"}`, or `skipped` / `abandoned`.
        \\- Call it ALONE in a batch: any other tool call in the same batch is discarded,
        \\  because asking ends the turn.
        \\
        \\INPUT:
        \\- question (required): the question itself. Markdown allowed. Ask exactly one.
        \\- header (optional): ≤40-char card title, e.g. "Deploy target".

        \\- allow_free_text (optional, default true): offer an "Other — type your own
        \\  answer" box alongside the options.
        \\- multi_select (optional, default false): let the human pick several options.
        \\- recommended (optional): must exactly match one of `options`. Rendered as a
        \\  "recommended" chip so the human can accept your suggestion in one click.
