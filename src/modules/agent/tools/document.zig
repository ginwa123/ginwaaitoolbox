//! `add_document` / `edit_document` / `delete_document` / `search_documents`
//! — the agent tools that let a model read and write its own workspace's
//! document store (Migration 098).
//!
//! SCOPE, and why it is not a parameter
//! ────────────────────────────────────
//! There is deliberately NO `workspace_id` in ANY input struct or tool
//! schema. A model-supplied workspace id would be a spoofing
//! vector: the LLM would be choosing which isolation boundary it lands
//! inside. Instead `caller_session_id` arrives as a plain function
//! parameter from the exec wrapper (`ctx.session_id`), and
//! `workspace_scope.resolveWorkspaceId` maps it to a workspace. The same
//! resolver `read_workspace_session` uses, so "which workspace am I?" has
//! exactly one answer in the codebase.
//!
//! The exec wrapper parses JSON with `ignore_unknown_fields = true`, so
//! a model that hallucinates `"workspace_id": "ws_other"` has it silently
//! dropped rather than honoured. `static contract: document tools never
//! accept a workspace_id` below asserts the field stays out of the struct.
//!
//! Fail-closed resolution
//! ──────────────────────
//! A session with no resolvable workspace gets a readable tool error, not
//! a fallback. Guessing a workspace — or defaulting to "the first one" —
//! would turn an unresolvable session into a cross-workspace write.
//!
//! Result shape: every function returns an inner JSON string. Success
//! carries the stored row; failure carries `{"error": "..."}`, which the
//! exec wrapper re-probes and flips to `success=false` so the model sees a
//! failure rather than a successful wrapper around an error body.

    \\- `title` is REQUIRED and must be non-blank. It is the label shown in the sidebar's Documents list, so make it a human-readable name, not a slug.
    \\- `content` is the markdown body and may be empty (you can create a heading-only stub and fill it in with `edit_document`).

    \\- Results are PAGED: `limit` (default 20, max 100) caps how many rows you get back, `total` is the real match count, `offset` continues the listing, and `hint` names the exact next offset.
    \\- An invalid pattern is not a failure: it is matched as a literal substring and the result carries `pattern_warning`. Read it instead of retrying blindly.
