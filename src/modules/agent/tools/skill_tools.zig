//! Skill agent tools: `search_skills` + `use_skill` + `remove_skill` +
//! `add_skill` + `edit_skill`.
//!
//! Every one of them is now a thin, honest wrapper over
//! `pabrikcore.skills_store` (Migration 101's `skills` / `skill_assets`
//! tables). A skill used to be a FILE whose identity was a pathname, and
//! every tool carried that shape: `is_global` chose a directory,
//! `cwd`/`environment` chose another, `use_skill` took a `path` ending in
//! `SKILL.MD`, and `search_skills` handed the path back. Three prompt
//! rules existed only to tell the model "pass the path verbatim, never
//! construct it from the name". All of it is gone. A skill is a row keyed
//! by `(workspace_id, name)`; the only handle the model ever handles is a
//! NAME.
//!
//! What is gone from the tool surface, and why
//! ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//!   `scope` / `is_global` — there is no longer a "global" tier. A skill
//!     wanted in two workspaces is two rows, which is one mechanism
//!     instead of a flag and a table that can disagree.
//!   `cwd` — the workspace comes from the calling session, not from a
//!     directory the model names.
//!   `path` — nothing on this side is a file any more.
//!   `session_id` on `remove_skill` — it was already unused; the real
//!     session id arrives as a function parameter from the exec wrapper.
//!
//! Workspace scope, and why it is not a parameter
//! ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//! Deliberately absent from EVERY input struct and schema: the model
//! resolves its workspace server-side from `caller_session_id` via
//! `workspace_scope.resolveWorkspaceId`, exactly as `document.zig` does.
//! A model-supplied `workspace_id` would be a spoofing vector — the LLM
//! would be choosing which isolation boundary it writes inside. The exec
//! wrapper parses with `ignore_unknown_fields`, so a hallucinated
//! `"workspace_id": "ws_other"` is dropped rather than honoured; the
//! static contract test at the bottom of this file fails the build if the
//! field is ever added back.
//!
//! `search_skills`' executor lives in `tools_exec_skills.zig`, not here:
//! its matching engine (`progressive_regex.zig`) is under
//! `src/agentic_loop/`, and a `modules → agentic_loop` import closes a
//! cycle through the `pabrikcore` root. This module exports
//! `resolveWorkspaceScope` + `scopeErrorJSON` so the wrapper composes the
//! same glue `document.zig`'s wrapper does.

// The old suite was 51 tests, almost all of them building `/tmp` SKILL.MD
// trees on disk and asserting which file appeared where. There is no disk
// any more, so most of them were testing a destination that does not
// exist. What replaces them asks the questions that are actually live:
//
//   * Does a skill written through `add_skill` read back through
//     `use_skill`? (Round trip, including the EMPTY description the
//     `COALESCE(NULLIF(?, ''), '')` bind trap used to swallow.)
//   * Is `workspace_id` really the isolation boundary in both directions?
//   * Does the workspace come from the SESSION, not from anything the
//     model says?
//   * Does a not-found refusal stay truthful (loaded: false, with the
//     names that DO exist)?
//   * Does `edit_skill` report an ineffective patch as a failure?
//   * Does the frontmatter still get generated exactly once?
//
// Every row below is seeded through the STORE, never with raw SQL. A test
// that INSERTs bypasses the `COALESCE(NULLIF(?, ''), '')` write path and
// therefore passes while the real tool fails — that is the whole class of
// bug the store's own fixture is written to avoid.
