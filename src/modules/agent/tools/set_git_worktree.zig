    \\## Set Git Worktree Tool — Behavior (MANDATORY when applicable)
    \\If you are creating a worktree, or the human requests a git worktree,
    \\you MUST call `set_git_worktree` before any `bash`/`read_file`/`write_file`
    \\operation touches repo files. Never operate on the original repo path.
    \\
    \\- Canonical root (Option A): `$HOME/.config/nalar/.worktrees/<task-slug>`.
    \\  Example: `/home/you/.config/nalar/.worktrees/fix-login`.
    \\  The kanban dialog prefills this absolute path as the `Path:` line after
    \\  `#Notes UseGitWorktree`. Prefer it when given; when the note has no
    \\  `Path:` line, create the worktree under the same root derived from the
    \\  task name.
    \\- If a `Path:` value starts with `~/`, expand `~` to `$HOME` first —
    \\  `validatePath` rejects non-absolute paths.
    \\- The note may also carry a `Base: <ref>` line (e.g. `Base: origin/main`).
    \\  Pass that value as the `base` argument so the worktree branches FROM
    \\  that ref instead of the repo's current HEAD. Omit `base` when the note
    \\  has no `Base:` line.
    \\- `path` MUST NOT contain `..`.
    \\- The parent directory MUST exist.
    \\- Once set, all subsequent `bash`/`read_file`/`write_file` operations run
    \\  inside that worktree.
    \\- Pass `clear=true` to remove the binding before switching or finishing.

A custom absolute path elsewhere is accepted for ad-hoc use. While bound, bash/read_file/write_file/text_replace/glob/search operate on the worktree instead of the session's original cwd. The branch defaults to 'worktree/<basename(path)>'. Pass `base` (e.g. 'origin/main') to create the branch FROM that ref instead of the repo's current HEAD — the kanban note carries it as the `Base:` line. If a path starts with `~/`, expand `~` to `$HOME` before calling (non-absolute paths are rejected). Call again with a different path to switch the binding to that worktree. Pass clear=true to remove the worktree directory and clear the binding.

Use `bash` + `git -C <repo> worktree list --porcelain` to inspect the current state if the error is unclear.
