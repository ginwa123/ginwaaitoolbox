//! Agent-callable tool: `list_secrets` — the NAMES of the secrets stored in
//! the calling session's workspace, and nothing else.
//!
//! Wire shape:
//!   input:  {} (no params — the workspace is resolved server-side from the
//!           `ToolExecContext.session_id` in the exec adapter)
//!   output: <list_secrets><count>N</count><secrets>
//!             <secret><name>..</name><updated_at>..</updated_at></secret>...
//!           </secrets></list_secrets>
//!
//! ## Why the schema carries no `workspace_id`
//!
//! `add_document` / `edit_document` / `read_workspace_session` all resolve
//! their own workspace from the session rather than taking one as an
//! argument, and for a tool that only ever reads NAMES that is the whole
//! security model: there is no parameter through which a model — or a
//! prompt-injected command line — could name a workspace it does not
//! belong to. Adding a `workspace_id` property later would be a privilege
//! escalation, so the test at the bottom of this file asserts on the
//! serialized schema and not merely on the field count.
//!
//! ## Why no `value`
//!
//! The same argument, one level down: the stored credential must not be
//! reachable from a discovery call at all. `secrets_store.listSecretNames`
//! selects `name` alone, so the exec adapter physically cannot build a
//! payload containing one.
