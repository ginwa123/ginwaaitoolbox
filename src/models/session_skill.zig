//! Data model for the `session_skills` entity table.

//! Tracks which skills each session has loaded. The skill loader
//! writes here so a session restart re-hydrates the same skill set
//! without re-reading the skill files from disk.
//!
//! Schema: Migration 009 (`add_session_skills`).
//!
//! Composite PRIMARY KEY: (session_id, skill_name).
//!
//! Note: `loaded_at` is stored as INTEGER (unix-seconds), distinct
//! from the DATETIME convention used by most other tables.
