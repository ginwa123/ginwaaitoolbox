//! `POST /api/llm/session/:session_id/answer` — resolve a pending
//! `ask_user` question and resume the conversation.
//!
//! ## The order is load-bearing
//!
//! 1. validate the request (see `AnswerError` for the status mapping);
//! 2. mark the `session_pending_question` row resolved;
//! 3. **rewrite the tool-result `llm_history` row in place** with the
//!    resolved JSON payload, and push its `llm_full` frame so an
//!    open `ChatView` flips the card without a reload;
//! 4. start a new run so the model continues with the answer in context.
//!
//! Steps 3 and 4 must not swap. Tool-result rows are written with
//! `is_feed_to_llm = 1`, so a run started first would hand the model
//! `"status":"pending"` — and it might guess. If step 3 fails we return
//! an error and leave the row `pending`, which keeps a Retry safe; the
//! reverse order would fail *silently* into a wrong answer.
//!
//! ## Idempotency
//!
//! A double-click, a browser retry or a late Retry after a 200-that-was-lost
//! must never 4xx — resolving an already-resolved question returns 200 with
//! the stored status. Only genuinely bad input is a 400/403/404.
