/**
 * Whole-file diff reader — the ONE way the frontend asks for a file's full
 * context, and the reason "Whole file" costs one request instead of one per
 * click.
 *
 * Deliberately SEPARATE from `helpers/folderDiffCache.ts`: that snapshot is
 * the 3-line-context diff the sidebar re-primes on every 30 s poll, and it
 * holds EVERY changed file. Writing a full-context body into it would either
 * bloat every poll or silently swap the diff view's own content. Different
 * question, different cache.
 *
 * `refused` is a real answer, not an error: the server declines to serve a
 * file whose full-context diff is over its budget, because a truncated
 * "whole file" reads as a complete one. The caller offers the code viewer.
