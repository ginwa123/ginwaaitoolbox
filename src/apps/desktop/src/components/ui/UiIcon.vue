/**
 * The one component every non-brand glyph in the app renders through.
 *
 * It replaces the emoji that used to stand in for icons. The rule this
 * enforces (`AGENTS.md` — "No Emoji as Icons; Use Inline SVG") is not
 * taste: an emoji's pixel height comes from the platform's emoji font,
 * so a row built from 📝 ➕ 🗑️ 🔄 📋 ❓ was six sizes tall instead of one,
 * and the same commit drew differently on Windows, macOS and Linux. An
 * SVG inherits `currentColor` and its box from the `size` prop, so a
 * panel that mixes a label and an icon gets one row height and one
 * palette.
 *
 * What it also buys is assertability. A spec can pin `data-icon="trash"`
 * and the registry can answer "is `trash` a name?"; neither is possible
 * against an emoji, which is why the emoji status column was untestable.
