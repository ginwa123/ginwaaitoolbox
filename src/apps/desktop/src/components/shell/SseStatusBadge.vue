  SseStatusBadge.vue

  A small inline pill that surfaces the GLOBAL SSE connection state
  held by the SSE bus (`helpers/sseBus.ts`). Reads `bus.state`
  reactively and renders NOTHING for the common case (`open`) so the
  chat UI is unchanged when the connection is healthy.

  Visible states
  ──────────────
  - `connecting`    → grey pill "Connecting…"
  - `reconnecting`  → amber pill "Reconnecting… (attempt N)"
  - `failed`        → red pill "Connection lost"
  - `open`, `closed` → hidden (default)

  Why the badge self-subscribes
  ─────────────────────────────
  Before this chunk the badge took a `client: SseClient` prop. After
  Chunks 1–7 the desktop app has ONE global SseClient owned by the
  bus; per-chat clients are gone. Hard-coding the bus as the data
  source is simpler and matches the rest of the app:

    1. No parent has to thread a client reference through
    2. The badge reflects the same connection that drives every other
       SSE consumer (chats list, workspace store, sub-agent peek)
    3. Mounting order is trivial — `App.vue` installs the bus in
       `onMounted` (Chunk 5), and every component mounted after that
       can call `useSseBus()` safely

  The badge counts reconnect attempts locally (the bus's state
  ShallowRef exposes only the state, not the attempt number, so we
  track it ourselves: bump on every `reconnecting` transition,
  reset on `open`/`closed`).

  Requires `useSseBus()` — the bus must be installed before this
  component mounts. `App.vue` does the install.

<script setup lang="ts">
import { onUnmounted, ref, toRef, watch } from 'vue'

import { useSseBus } from '../../helpers/sseBus'

const bus = useSseBus()
// `bus.state` is a `ShallowRef<SseState>` and this badge only ever READS it,
// so alias it rather than copying it into a local `ref` and syncing with a
// watcher. The copy also had to be seeded from `bus.state.value`, which is
// exactly the kind of snapshot that goes stale.
const state = toRef(bus.state)
const attempt = ref(0)

// The remaining job is NOT derivation: it counts transitions of an EXTERNAL
// signal. `attempt` depends on its own history, so `computed()` cannot express
// it, and there is no local handler to move it into — the SSE bus reconnects
// on its own. `immediate` keeps the first render honest, and the returned
// stop-handle tears the watcher down in `onUnmounted`.
const stop = watch(
  bus.state,
  (s) => {
    // Tracked locally because the bus's state ShallowRef does NOT expose the
    // underlying `SseClient`'s `info.attempt` — only the state name.
    if (s === 'reconnecting') {
      attempt.value += 1
    } else if (s === 'open' || s === 'closed') {
      attempt.value = 0
    }
  },
  { immediate: true },
