  SseStatusBadge.vue

  A small inline pill that surfaces the GLOBAL SSE connection state
  held by the SSE bus (`helpers/sseBus.ts`). Reads `bus.state`
  reactively and renders NOTHING for the common case (`open`) so the
  chat UI is unchanged when the connection is healthy.

  Visible states
  ──────────────
  - `connecting`    → grey pill "Connecting…"
  - `reconnecting`  → amber pill "Reconnecting… (attempt N)"
  - `failed`        → red pill "Connection lost"
  - `open`, `closed` → hidden (default)

  Why the badge self-subscribes
  ─────────────────────────────
  Before this chunk the badge took a `client: SseClient` prop. After
  Chunks 1–7 the desktop app has ONE global SseClient owned by the
  bus; per-chat clients are gone. Hard-coding the bus as the data
  source is simpler and matches the rest of the app:

    1. No parent has to thread a client reference through
    2. The badge reflects the same connection that drives every other
       SSE consumer (chats list, workspace store, sub-agent peek)
    3. Mounting order is trivial — `App.vue` installs the bus in
       `onMounted` (Chunk 5), and every component mounted after that
       can call `useSseBus()` safely

  The badge counts reconnect attempts locally (the bus's state
  ShallowRef exposes only the state, not the attempt number, so we
  track it ourselves: bump on every `reconnecting` transition,
  reset on `open`/`closed`).

  Requires `useSseBus()` — the bus must be installed before this
  component mounts. `App.vue` does the install.

const bus = useSseBus()
// `bus.state` is a `ShallowRef<SseState>` and this badge only ever READS it,
// so alias it rather than copying it into a local `ref` and syncing with a
// watcher. The copy also had to be seeded from `bus.state.value`, which is
// exactly the kind of snapshot that goes stale.
const state = toRef(bus.state)
const attempt = ref(0)

// The remaining job is NOT derivation: it counts transitions of an EXTERNAL
// signal. `attempt` depends on its own history, so `computed()` cannot express
// it, and the bus exposes no state-subscribe — only the `state` ShallowRef.
// The template reads `state`, so every transition re-renders this badge:
// onMounted seeds the initial state (the old `immediate: true`), and the
// prev-value guard below counts each transition exactly once.
const countStateTransition = (s: typeof bus.state.value) => {
  // Tracked locally because the bus's state ShallowRef does NOT expose the
  // underlying `SseClient`'s `info.attempt` — only the state name.
