/**
 * Position state + dismiss wiring for the right-click context menus
 * (KanbanTaskContextMenu.vue, OpenInNewTabMenu.vue, GitBranchMenu.vue).
 * Hosts keep their own payload (chat, item, task ids); this only owns
 * the nullable screen position and the listeners that dismiss it.
 *
 * Dismissal triggers:
 *   - Escape
 *   - mousedown outside the menu
 *   - a scroll that actually moves the row the menu was opened from
 *
 * Why the scroll dismiss is scoped rather than global: every menu is
 * Teleported to `body` and positioned `fixed`, so it does not move with
 * its row. When the row scrolls away — or the VirtualScroller unmounts
 * it — the menu is orphaned over unrelated content and must close. But
 * a scroll anywhere ELSE in the app (the chat transcript, the file
 * tree, the right sidebar) leaves the menu exactly where the user put
 * it, and closing on that is the "menu suddenly closed" report. So the
 * listener only fires when the scroll target actually contains the
 * anchor, or the anchor has been torn out of the DOM.
 *
 * Edge clamping: menus are placed at the raw clientX/clientY. A card in a
 * 280px-wide column can be right-clicked near the viewport's right edge,
 * which would push the menu (and its "Move to column" submenu) off-screen.
 * `clampToViewport` pulls the coordinates back inside.

   *     exactly where the user put it, so it stays open.
   *
