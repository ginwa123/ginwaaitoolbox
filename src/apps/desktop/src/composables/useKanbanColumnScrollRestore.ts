/**
 * Persists a kanban column body's `scrollTop` to `localStorage` across
 * component mounts.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 *   A kanban column's card list is a `<VirtualScroller>` that owns a
 *   `overflow-y-auto` container. When the surrounding view unmounts — the
 *   tab strip switching from the board tab to a task-chat tab, or (with tab
 *   mode off) the chat replacing the board in the single view — Vue tears the
 *   column down, and the new instance starts at `scrollTop = 0`. The user
 *   loses their place in a long column (the `merged` / `in_review` columns
 *   routinely hold 50+ cards).
 *
 *   The horizontal sibling `useKanbanScrollRestore` already solves this for
 *   the columns ROW; `useChatScrollRestore` solves it for the chat's message
 *   list. This is the third case: vertical scrolling *inside* a column.
 *
 * Why a separate composable rather than a flag on `useKanbanScrollRestore`:
 *   - The element it targets appears LATE. The scroller is behind
 *     `v-if="cardsInColumn.length > 0"`, so on a cold load (tasks still
 *     arriving from the API) the container is null at the column's
 *     `onMounted`. Losing that moment would mean never attaching the
 *     listeners — the position would never be saved in the first place. So
 *     this one wires up on mount AND on update (cards arriving re-renders
 *     the host, which lands in the update hook with the element present).
 *   - It restores unconditionally. `useChatScrollRestore` deliberately
 *     refuses to restore a position within 40 px of the bottom (a chat should
 *     land on the newest message); a kanban column scrolled to its last card
 *     should land exactly there.
 *
 * Behavior:
 *   - **On the ref becoming non-null**: attaches `scroll` (passive) and, when
 *     supported, `scrollend`; then restores after two `requestAnimationFrame`
 *     ticks (the scroller needs a paint to size its spacers before an absolute
 *     `scrollTop` can land anywhere but 0), waiting up to 500 ms for the
 *     column to become scrollable (`scrollHeight > clientHeight`). An
 *     immediate `max <= 0` bail would silently drop the restore for any column
 *     whose cards are not laid out by the second frame. Clamped to
 *     `scrollHeight - clientHeight`.
 *   - **On `scroll`**: captures `scrollTop` synchronously (cheap) and schedules
 *     a debounced 250 ms write.
 *   - **On `scrollend`**: writes immediately, cancelling the pending write.
 *   - **On unmount**: flushes the last CAPTURED value — deliberately not a
 *     fresh `el.scrollTop` read. By the time the hook runs the element may
 *     already be detached, and a detached element reports `scrollTop = 0`,
 *     which would overwrite a perfectly good saved position with zero.
 *
 * Storage key convention: `kanban-col-scroll-<itemId>:<columnId>` (the caller
 * composes it). Accepted as a plain `string` or a `Ref<string>` so it can be
 * computed from props reactively.
 *
 * Edge cases:
 *   - `localStorage` access is wrapped in `try/catch`, so private-mode or
 *     quota-exceeded failures don't throw. Only cross-reload persistence is
 *     lost; the in-session value still restores if the element returns.
 *   - A single mounted element is wired exactly once; a remount (the column
 *     going empty and then non-empty again) wires the NEW element and restores
 *     the last saved position, which is the least surprising outcome.
 *   - Exposes nothing — purely side-effecting, so state is just
 *     `localStorage[key]` plus `element.scrollTop`.
