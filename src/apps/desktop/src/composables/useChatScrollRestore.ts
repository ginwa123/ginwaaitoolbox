/**
 * Persists a vertically-scrolling container's `scrollTop` to
 * `localStorage` across component mounts, with a chat-specific
 * "near bottom" detection: if the saved position is within
 * `BOTTOM_THRESHOLD_PX` of the current `scrollHeight - clientHeight`,
 * `restore()` returns `null` so the caller falls through to
 * `scrollToBottom` instead of restoring a stale bottom edge (which
 * could be missing a few messages that arrived during the close
 * window).
 *
 * Why this exists:
 *   ChatView uses `:key="task-<id>"` in the surrounding
 *   `v-if/v-else-if` chain in AppLayout.vue. Vue 3 does NOT reuse
 *   component instances across keys at different DOM parents, so
 *   closing + reopening a chat (even the same chat) tears down and
 *   recreates ChatView. Without this composable, the new instance's
 *   scrollTop resets to 0 and the user loses their reading position.
 *
 *   The horizontal sibling `useKanbanScrollRestore` already solves
 *   this for the kanban board's columns row. This composable
 *   mirrors that pattern but for the chat's vertical scroll + the
 *   "near bottom" branch that the kanban does not need.
 *
 * Behavior:
 *   - **On mount**: reads the saved `scrollTop` from `localStorage`,
 *     waits for `scrollHeight > clientHeight` (the VirtualScroller's
 *     item measurement) or a 500 ms safety net, then attaches
 *     scroll + scrollend listeners. Exposes `restore()` (returns
 *     the saved value, or `null` if at-bottom / not set / not
 *     scrollable) and `restorePosition(value)` (clamps + applies).
 *   - **On `scrollend`** (fast path): writes the current `scrollTop`
 *     synchronously and cancels any pending debounced write.
 *   - **On `scroll`** (fallback path): schedules a debounced 250 ms
 *     write via `setTimeout`. Each new scroll event resets the
 *     timer so a 60-Hz scroll stream produces one write per
 *     scroll-stop.
 *   - **On unmount**: flushes any pending debounced write so a fast
 *     scroll → click → remount cycle doesn't lose the latest
 *     position, then removes the scroll + scrollend listeners.
 *
 * Storage key convention: caller composes the full key (e.g.
 * `chat-scroll-<taskId>`). The key is accepted as either a plain
 * `string` or a `Ref<string>` so it can be computed from props
 * reactively.
 *
 * Edge cases:
 *   - `localStorage` access is wrapped in `try/catch` so
 *     private-mode / quota-exceeded failures don't throw. The
 *     in-memory restore still works for the current session; only
 *     reload persistence is lost.
 *   - The composable swallows `localStorage.setItem` throws so
 *     private-mode browsers don't surface errors.
 *   - The composable does NOT save on programmatic scrolls
 *     differently from user scrolls (no flag). The `scrollTop`
 *     value is what the user sees regardless of who moved it; the
 *     "near bottom" branch in `restore()` covers the case where
 *     the user was at the bottom when they closed.
 *
 * NOT for vertical scrolling inside a `VirtualScroller`'s
 * `beginPreserve`/`endPreserve` window — that flow has its own
 * anchor-tracking mechanism. This composable is for the persistent
 * across-mount case.

   * tail-gap cap makes that overshoot routine at the end of a long chat), so a

   * `maxTailGap` below the DOM edge. Comparing that save against the DOM edge
   * would (a) fail to recognise it as "still at the bottom" and restore a
   * stale position, and (b) clamp the restore to the DOM edge, parking the
   * reader in the blank region below the transcript. ChatView passes the
