/**
 * stripAnsiEscapes — remove terminal escape sequences from captured
 * process output before it is rendered.
 *
 * ## Why the frontend needs this at all
 *
 * The backend (`helpers/ansi.zig`, wired into `shell.result_to_json`)
 * already strips escapes for NEW output, and that is where the fix
 * belongs. This is a second, independent guard for two narrower cases:
 *
 * 1. **Live / partial payloads.** A streaming or background-process log
 *    tail can reach the UI before the final serialiser has run.
 * 2. **Any future producer** that hands raw bytes to the renderer
 *    (the terminal websocket is the obvious candidate).
 *
 * ## What it CANNOT fix — do not expect it to
 *
 * Every shell result captured before the backend fix is stored with its
 * ESC byte already flattened to U+FFFD and the printable CSI parameters
 * orphaned beside it (`<U+FFFD>[7mwarning <U+FFFD>[0m`). At that point
 * the escape is gone: `[7m` is no longer a sequence, it is literal
 * text, and nothing in this module — or any amount of cleverness — can
 * tell it apart from a user who genuinely typed `[7m`. Those rows need a
 * migration or stay as they are; guessing here would silently eat real
 * output. New output is clean; old output is what it is.
 *
 * ## Why a hand-rolled scanner and not `text.replace(/\x1b\[[0-9;]*m/g, '')`
 *
 * A regex that only knows SGR (`ESC [ … m`) leaves the cursor, erase and
 * private-mode sequences behind, and one written naively (`/[\s\S]*?/`)
 * eats real text. This mirrors the ECMA-48 state machine in
 * `src/helpers/ansi.zig` — CSI, OSC, DCS/SOS/PM/APC and two-byte escapes
 * — so the two implementations cannot drift on what counts as an escape.
 *
 * Mirrors `zig src/helpers/ansi.zig`. Tests in `stripAnsiEscapes.spec.ts`
 * assert behaviour on real byte sequences; keep the two in step.
