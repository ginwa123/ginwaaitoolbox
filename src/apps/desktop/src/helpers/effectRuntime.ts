/**
 * The generic Effect seam for Vue `<script setup>` callers.
 *
 * `sync/runtime.ts` is the same idea specialised to the sync slice (it
 * degrades to `null`/a fallback and reports a `SyncError`). This module is
 * the domain-neutral half: run any `Effect`, get its `Exit` back, and let
 * the CALLER decide what a failure means.
 *
 * That last part is the whole point. The bug this module exists to prevent is
 * a failure being collapsed into a value the UI cannot distinguish from a
 * legitimate answer — see the chatview's "How can I help you?" empty state
 * and the rule in AGENTS.md ("Frontend — No `try`/`catch` in the desktop
 * app; use Effect-TS"). A `catch` that returns `[]` makes "the backend is
 * down" and "this session has no messages" the same value. An `Exit` keeps
 * them apart.
