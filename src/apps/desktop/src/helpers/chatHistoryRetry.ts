/**
 * Retry policy for the INITIAL transcript fetch in ChatView.
 *
 * Why this exists: the chatview used to abort a slow `/messages` round-trip
 * on `apiFetch`'s 15 s default and — because the loader swallowed the
 * failure into an empty transcript — render the empty state ("How can I help
 * you?") for a session that is full of messages. Two things had to change:
 * the failure must travel in the error channel, and the caller must WAIT
 * rather than surrender. This module owns the "how long do we wait" half.
 *
 * The composer is already disabled by `isInitializing` for the duration, so a
 * long wait costs the user nothing but a skeleton — which is exactly the
 * honest representation of "we asked the server and it hasn't answered yet".
 *
 * Effect-TS, not try/catch: the attempt is an `Effect`, so "it failed" is in
 * the return type and `Effect.retry` handles the policy. A `try`/`catch`
 * here would put the failure back in a position where a caller can quietly
 * drop it. See AGENTS.md, "Frontend — No `try`/`catch` in the desktop app".

 * warns about "slow TTFB". Not `0` (unbounded) — a genuinely hung backend
 * would then park the skeleton forever, which is the failure mode the
 * default timeout exists to prevent.
