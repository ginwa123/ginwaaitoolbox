/**
 * Per-window identity for the tab list.

 * `sessionStorage` is exactly the right lifetime here: it is per browser
 * tab / webview window, and it survives a reload of that window while a
 * brand-new window starts empty — which is what a browser does with its
 * tab strip. That is also why the tab list itself is keyed by this id in
 * `localStorage` instead of living in `sessionStorage`.
 *
 * Known limitation: some engines copy `sessionStorage` when a tab is
 * duplicated; such a duplicate shares the tab list with its source. That
 * is a benign outcome, not a corruption, so it is not defended against.
