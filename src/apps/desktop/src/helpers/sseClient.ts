/**
 * sseClient.ts
 *
 * Auto-reconnecting wrapper around the browser-native `EventSource`.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ───────────────
 * The previous pattern in the desktop app (e.g. `App.vue` worker
 * stream, `ChatsList.vue` session stream, `ChatView.vue` chat + queue
 * streams) was a raw `new EventSource(url)` plus a hand-rolled
 * `onerror` callback. Three things went wrong:
 *
 *   1. **No reconnect on 3 of the 4 streams.** The browser's native
 *      `EventSource` does auto-retry on network-level failures with
 *      a 3 s default — but only if the server sends the SSE spec's
 *      `retry:` field, and ONLY for some failure modes (4xx/5xx are
 *      not retried by the spec). On a `nalar` server restart, the new
 *      process serves the new connection, but the old `EventSource`
 *      is permanently dead and never reconnects.
 *
 *   2. **Naive retry in `App.vue` had two bugs.** A 5 s
 *      `setTimeout(reconnect)` was not stored, so it could fire
 *      after the component unmounted (timer leak) and could fire
 *      after a *second* transient error had already reconnected
 *      successfully, killing the working connection. See §10 of
 *      `docs/sse-reconnect-plan.md`.
 *
 *   3. **No lifecycle awareness.** Laptops that suspend, tabs
 *      that get backgrounded, and Wi-Fi that drops then reappears
 *      are common — and the previous code did not pause retries
 *      while the tab was hidden, nor fast-path on the browser's
 *      `online` event.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for SSE reconnection in
 * the desktop app. It is consumed by `api/index.ts` (the 4 factory
 * functions there are thin adapters) and can be consumed directly
 * for new streams.
 *
 * Public surface
 * ──────────────
 *   - `createSseClient(opts) → SseClient`
 *       Owns one `EventSource`, one retry timer, and the
 *       `visibilitychange` / `online` listeners. All cleaned up in
 *       `.close()`. **The constructor is fully async** — the
 *       initial `start()` is deferred to the next macrotask
 *       (`setTimeout(start, 0)`) so the HTTP request does not
 *       fire synchronously inside the caller. Tests that interact
 *       with `instances[0]` immediately after construction must
 *       call `vi.advanceTimersByTime(0)` to flush the deferred
 *       start.
 *   - `SseClient.close()` — terminal, no further reconnects.
 *   - `SseClient.reconnect()` — force a reconnect, resets attempt
 *       counter. Use it for a user-driven "Retry" button.
 *   - `SseClient.getState()` — synchronous read of the current
 *       state. Use it in templates / ref-bound UI.
 *   - `SseClient.onStateChange(cb)` — subscribe to state
 *       transitions. Returns an unsubscribe function. Use it to
 *       drive reactive UI (e.g. a "Reconnecting…" badge).

 * Notes:
 *   - `reconnecting → connecting` is the timer-or-event fast path
 *     (a fresh `EventSource` is constructed).
 *   - `failed` is terminal. The only way out is `.reconnect()` or
 *     constructing a new client.
 *   - `visibilitychange → visible` AND `online` event both
 *     fast-path `reconnecting → connecting` (cancel the timer,
 *     start a fresh attempt).
 *   - `pagehide` AND `beforeunload` (added in the 2026-01-15 fix)
 *     call `close()` synchronously. Without this, the browser only
 *     eventually tears down the underlying socket on page unload,
 *     and the SSE connection lingers in the network panel as
 *     "open" / "pending" until the server-side timeout fires. The
 *     browser's `EventSource` close method is also needed to make
 *     the browser drop the stream from the network panel
 *     immediately on refresh / tab close / navigation. Set
 *     `closeOnUnload: false` to opt out (tests, SSR).

  //                 sender stalled (zombie loop, panic'd worker
  //                 thread, etc.) or the server killed the SSE
  //                 connection without RST/FIN.
  //   - 'network'   Browser reported offline (navigator.onLine ===
  //                 false via the 'offline' event or the property
  //                 check). TCP socket almost certainly dead.
  //   - 'browser'   Tab is hidden AND silence started after the
  //                 hide transition. Browsers throttle / pause
  //                 EventSource when the tab is backgrounded, which
