/**
 * Per-user browser-storage namespacing (plan 2026-09-25, W5).
 *
 * Every localStorage / IndexedDB key in the app is origin-global: two users
 * signing in on the same browser profile share one key space, so B inherits
 * A's cached workspace list, active chat, open tabs, task media and diff
 * comments — and logout clears none of it. This module is the single place
 * that turns a logical key into a per-user physical key.
 *
 * Contract:
 * - `userScopedKey(key)` returns the key unchanged when there is no identity
 *   (auth off, or `/api/auth/me` not resolved yet) — so the auth-off path is
 *   byte-identical and needs no migration.
 * - With an identity it returns `key::u:<userId>`.
 * - The identity is cached in module memory and refreshed from
 *   `getAuthMeCached()`; `setCurrentUserId` is the synchronous setter used by
 *   the auth flow (login / logout / identity change) so a caller never has to
 *   await before reading a key.
 *
 * Why a suffix and not a prefix: existing keys are already namespaced by
 * feature (`nalar-workspaces:v1`, `active-chat-id`), and a suffix keeps the
 * feature prefix readable in devtools while making the user boundary
 * unambiguous. It also means a legacy (unscoped) key can never collide with a
 * scoped one.
