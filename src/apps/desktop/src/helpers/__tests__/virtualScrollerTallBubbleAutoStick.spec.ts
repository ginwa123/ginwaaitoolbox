/**
 * The reported shape, at the layer that can express it:
 *
 *   "Chatview has issue if sse send a llm chunk and llm full data finish
 *    reason stop, its like automatically go to bottom scrollbar chatview"
 *   + "if the messages many and the content response is long, it is not auto
 *      scroll bottom"
 *
 * THE SCENARIO
 *   A long chat (1000 messages) whose bubbles are not uniform: many are a
 *   normal paragraph, some are taller than the whole viewport, and some carry
 *   a collapsed "thought"/reasoning section that is a small pill until it is
 *   expanded. One long streamed response then arrives.
 *
 * WHY IT BREAKS
 *   Two things must be true at once, which is why a 20-message test never sees
 *   it:
 *
 *   1. The sizer is very tall (1000 messages), so a correction to the model
 *      above the viewport is measured in THOUSANDS of pixels, not tens.
 *   2. The virtual window keeps EXPANDING while the reader follows the stream,
 *      because the tall bubbles render far taller than the estimator guessed.
 *      Every newly rendered row above the anchor is measured for the first
 *      time, and its real height replaces the guess.
 *
 *   The anchor pass then compensates: `scrollTop += (prefix after − prefix
 *   before)`. That is correct for a reader in the history and wrong for a
 *   reader at the bottom, who has no view to preserve — the content they are
 *   reading is exactly what just got resized. The write strands them thousands
 *   of pixels above the bottom, and ChatView reads that as "the user left the
 *   bottom", disarming every follow gate for the rest of the mount. The rest
 *   of the long response then streams off-screen and the reader watches a gap
 *   grow. (`tests/functional_ui/chatview_at_bottom_stick_ui_test.py` recorded
 *   it as a −15,900px correction with `scrollHeight` essentially unchanged.)
 *
 * THE INVARIANT UNDER TEST
 *   Scoped to the scroller's own responsibility, one pass at a time: **if a
 *   measure pass finds the reader at the bottom, that pass leaves them at the
 *   bottom** — whatever it just did to the model. The correction is still
 *   APPLIED (the sizer converges); it is just aimed at the bottom instead of
 *   at the anchor.
 *
 *   Re-sticking across the passes BETWEEN remeasures is ChatView's job
 *   (`scrollToBottom` after `remeasure`, and `onContentShift` on growth), so
 *   asserting that here would be asserting the wrong layer. The companion
 *   `ChatView.tallBubbleAutoStick.spec.ts` asserts the app's own `isAtBottom`
 *   flag end-to-end over the same shape.
 *
 * Note on the reasoning section: jsdom cannot lay it out, so "tall because an
 * expanded thought block" is modelled here as height — which is what the
 * scroller actually consumes.
