// The worker-running surfaces (sidebar rows, kanban card, kanban row,
// task-detail dialog, chat app bar) all need the same string, and a
// "4m 12s" that disagrees with the card's "4m 12s" is a bug report
// waiting to happen. `SpawnSubAgent.vue` already had a private
// `formatElapsed` for sub-agent rows; this is that function promoted to
// a shared, tested helper so both surfaces render identically.
//
// Deliberately NOT `formatRelativeTime` (helpers/relativeTime.ts): that
// one buckets into "5m" / "2h" / "3d" and collapses everything under a
// minute to "now", which is useless for a run that has been going for
// 40 seconds. A running worker needs second-level resolution.
