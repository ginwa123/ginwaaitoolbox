/**
 * Shared FOLDER-mode diff snapshot — the app's only way to read a file diff.
 *
 * Why this exists: `POST /api/git/file/diffs` in folder mode returns every
 * changed path under a folder (or the whole repo) in ONE request. Before this
 * module, two components still reached for the per-file
 * `GET /api/git/file/diff`, so opening the diff panel fired one request per
 * click and the standalone viewer fired one per file opened. That is the
 * request flood in the browser's network tab.
 *
 * So: ONE snapshot per cwd, shared by every reader.
 *   - `primeFolderDiffs` — the sidebar already fetched the whole repo for its
 *     file list; hand the payload over so a click costs ZERO requests.
 *   - `readFolderDiff` — synchronous read, for a click on a file the snapshot
 *     already covers.
 *   - `fetchFolderDiff` — read, or revalidate with a single shared folder
 *     request (concurrent callers are deduped into the same promise).
 *
 * TTL is 30s on purpose: that is the sidebar's existing poll cadence
 * (`SidebarDiffPanel.loadGitStatus`), so a reader can never drift further
 * behind the panel than the panel already does. The panel re-primes on every
 * poll, which resets the clock for everyone.
 *
 * The frontend and the backend ship together, so there is no "older server"
 * to fall back to — a rejected fetch REJECTS here and the caller renders an
 * error, rather than silently degrading into a per-file request storm.
