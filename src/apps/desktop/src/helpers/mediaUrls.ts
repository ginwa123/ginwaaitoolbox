/**
 * The `||`-delimited media-URL wire format.
 *
 * `llm_history.image_url` / `.video_url` (and `workspace_item_tasks.image_urls`)
 * hold a single TEXT column carrying N base64 data URLs. The backend joins them
 * with TWO pipes — see `insert_llm_histories.zig` ("Join multiple image URLs
 * with || delimiter"), `image_urls_validation.zig`, and the wire docs on
 * `http_response.zig`.
 *
 * The read side is deliberately more permissive than the writer: every reader in
 * the codebase splits on a SINGLE `|` and drops empty segments
 * (`image_urls_validation.zig:64`, `video_urls_validation.zig:43`,
 * `llm_history.zig` history rows, Android's `ChatApi.splitPipeDelimited`). That
 * handles `A|B`, `A||B` and `A||B||C` identically, so it survives both the
 * current writer and any `|`-joined value still sitting in the queue table.
 *
 * Splitting on a single `|` WITHOUT dropping empties is the bug this module
 * exists to prevent: `"A||B".split('|')` yields `["A", "", "B"]`, and the `""`
 * becomes `<img src="">` — a broken-image icon in the transcript.
