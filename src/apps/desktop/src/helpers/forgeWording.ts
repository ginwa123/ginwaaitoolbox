/**
 * Provider-aware wording for the PR/MR surface.
 *
 * The backend stores a provider per attached change request
 * (`sessions.pr_provider`) and now answers `GET /api/git/pr/status` for
 * GitLab as well as GitHub. The UI has to follow, because "pull request"
 * is not a GitLab user's word — they say "merge request" — and two of the
 * constructs this module used to emit are outright wrong on GitLab:
 *
 *  - `<pr-url>/conflicts` is a GitHub-only route. GitLab has no such
 *    path; a link built that way is a guaranteed 404.
 *  - `<repo>/tree/<branch>` is GitHub-only. GitLab inserts a `/-/`
 *    discriminator, so its branch page is `<repo>/-/tree/<branch>`.
 *
 * One table, used by every component, is the only way those two stay
 * correct; the bug this replaces was three components each hardcoding
 * `github.com` prose.
