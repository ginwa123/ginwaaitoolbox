/**
 * Regression tests for the 2026-08-23 "stray TOOLS pill" bug.
 *
 * Background: `groupToolNames` showed a "tools" pill for any assistant
 * group whose next group was not role='tool'. During live SSE there
 * was a window where the assistant tool_calls row had arrived but
 * the tool result row had not — so the pill flashed even though a
 * structured tool card would appear a frame later. Worse, the pill
 * could persist wrongly if the tool group got collapsed / dropped /
 * merged by `filteredMessages` or `hasBubbleContent`.
 *
 * Fix: walk the WHOLE transcript for matching tool_call_ids and
 * suppress the pill when every tool call is already represented by a
 * structured card. Robust against ordering, merging, and live SSE
 * interleaving.
