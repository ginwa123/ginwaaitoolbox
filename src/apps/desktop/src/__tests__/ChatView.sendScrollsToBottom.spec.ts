/**
 * Sending or queueing a message must take the transcript to the bottom.
 *
 * ChatView's whole auto-stick is gated on `isAtBottom`: the `messages.length`
 * watcher returns early without it, `onContentShift` skips, and
 * `scrollToBottom(force = false)` does nothing. A reader who has scrolled up to
 * read history is, by definition, `isAtBottom === false`.
 *
 * So a send cannot be "scroll if we happen to be at the end" — it has to
 * *re-arm* the stick, and it has to do so SYNCHRONOUSLY. A forced
 * `scrollToBottom(true, …)` alone is not enough: it writes `container.scrollTop`
 * and leaves the flag to the native `scroll` event that follows, and the
 * browser does not fire one when the write is a no-op (the sizer already
 * reports a max scrollTop the container is already sitting at). The flag stays
 * false, and the SSE echo that carries the sent turn is answered by `Hold` —
 * the turn lands off-screen and the transcript never moves.
 *
 * These are source-level tests, following the ChatView convention (see
 * `ChatView.lazyPrefetch.spec.ts` for why): the mount-based ChatView specs
 * cannot get past the IndexedDB-backed history load in this environment. The
 * behavioural proof over a real browser — a real pabrik, a real Vite, a real
 * Chromium — is `tests/functional_ui/chatview_send_scrolls_to_bottom_ui_test.py`.
