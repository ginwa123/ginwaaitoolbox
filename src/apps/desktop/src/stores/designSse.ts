/**
 * DesignSse — bus-backed design-event handlers (Chunk 6 of the
 * design-mode-redesign plan).
 *
 * Mirrors `kanbanSse.ts` byte-for-byte in structure. The bus is
 * opened once by App.vue via `installSseBus`; this store just
 * subscribes to the `design` channel via `useSseBus().on('design',
 * ...)` and dispatches incoming events to the workspacesStore so
 * the local Pinia state stays in sync with the backend.
 *
 * The backend's design SSE routing keys (`design_element_created`,
 * `design_element_updated`, `design_element_deleted`) are GLOBAL
 * — every connected client receives every event. The bus listener
 * filters client-side by `event.workspace_id == activeWorkspaceId`
 * before dispatching to the store. Workspace switches update the
 * filter via `setActiveWorkspaceId` (no re-subscription — the bus
 * listener is workspace-agnostic).
 *
 * **Page-id tracking** — incoming events carry
 * `event.page_id + element_id`, so for a full re-fetch we need to
 * know which page the user is currently editing. Chunk 7 (AppLayout
 * v-else-if for design) will wire the active page id via the
 * workspacesStore (e.g. `activePageId` ref); the SSE handler in
 * this store will then resolve the right page before calling
 * `fetchDesignElements`. Until Chunk 7 lands, the handler takes a
 * conservative approach: re-fetch the elements for the event's
 * pageId directly (`fetchDesignElements(workspaceId, itemId,
 * pageId)`), trusting the workspaceStore's per-item
 * `design_elements` cache. The fetched data is the FULL page record
 * from the backend (the API returns `{ page, elements[] }`); the
 * store action overwrites the item's `design_elements` with the
 * response.
 *
 * Plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-08-design-mode-redesign.md
 *   Chunk 6.
