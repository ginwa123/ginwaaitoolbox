/**
 * KanbanSse — bus-backed kanban event handlers (Chunk 10 of the
 * unify-frontend-sse plan).
 *
 * Before this migration, the store opened its OWN EventSource via
 * `createUnifiedSseConnection` for the `kanban` channel — the 5th
 * duplicate subscription to a stream the bus (opened by App.vue at
 * app start via `installSseBus`) already subscribes to. That setup
 * opened an EventSource per Pinia store activation (and a 2nd one
 * for every `initKanbanSse` re-entry), saturating the browser's
 * per-origin HTTP/1.1 connection pool and triggering the chained
 * `ERR_INCOMPLETE_CHUNKED_ENCODING` reconnect loop.
 *
 * After: the store subscribes via `useSseBus().on('kanban', ...)`
 * (one listener per Pinia store activation, lifetime ≈ page
 * lifetime). The bus's singleton EventSource owns the actual network
 * stream and re-emits events to all subscribers with built-in
 * reconnect-on-drop.
 *
 * The async `initKanbanSse` signature is preserved (callers in
 * AppLayout's `initSseStores` `await` it) even though the body is
 * synchronous, because the cooperative-init semantic contract with
 * the AppLayout caller is part of the public API.
 *
 * The backend's kanban SSE routing keys (`kanban_column`,
 * `kanban_task`) are GLOBAL — every connected client receives every
 * event. The handler filters client-side by `event.workspace_id ==
 * activeWorkspaceId` before dispatching to workspacesStore. Workspace
 * switches update the filter via `setActiveWorkspaceId` (no
 * re-subscription — the bus listener is workspace-agnostic).
 *
 * Plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-30-unify-frontend-sse.md
 *   Chunk 10.

   * inside the handler closure, so we don't detach/re-attach.

   * Throws if the bus is not yet installed — call this AFTER App.vue's

   * `onMounted`, which runs after AppLayout.vue's mount in practice
   * (the AppLayout's `initSseStores` on workspace switch fires only
   * after both components have mounted, by which point the bus is
   * ready). The async signature preserves the cooperative-init
   * contract with that caller — even though the body is now
