/**
 * The sync engine's error channel.
 *
 * Before Effect, every failure in this subsystem was funnelled into a bare
 * `catch {}` that returned a fallback value, so a backend outage, a corrupt
 * IndexedDB database and a legitimately empty result all reached the UI as
 * the same value. The engine's callers could not tell "there is nothing new"
 * from "we could not check".
 *
 * Effect lets the failure travel in the type: every fallible operation below
 * returns `Effect<A, SyncError>`, and the caller decides whether to degrade
 * silently (current behaviour) or surface the reason. The two tags are
 * deliberately coarse because that is the distinction the UI actually acts
 * on — a local-cache problem is retried differently from a network problem,
 * and neither is a "no rows" answer.
