/**
 * The Effect seam for the sync slice.
 *
 * Two things live here:
 *
 *  1. `syncStoreLayer` — the local cache as a `Layer`, for code that composes
 *     a whole Effect program and wants the service in context.
 *  2. `runSyncEffect*` — the Effect seam for Vue `<script setup>` callers.
 *     The engines return `Effect`s; the components consuming them are
 *     ordinary script blocks. Effect's rule is that you never `await`
 *     without a plan for the failure, and the plan for a local-first cache
 *     is "degrade, but say why". These helpers encode that policy once, so
 *     each call site stays a one-liner and the *reason* is no longer
 *     discarded.
 *
 * `runSyncEffect` returns `null` on failure, the shape the old
 * `catch { return null }` produced, so call sites that already branched on
 * `if (delta)` keep their shape. `runSyncEffectOr` covers operations whose
 * "nothing there" value is not `null` (an empty row list, an absent cursor).
