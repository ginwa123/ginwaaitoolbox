//
// Runtime asset extraction: write a flat list of `AssetEntry` records
// (the source: webapp_assets.assets — see tools/codegen_webapp_assets.zig)
// to a fresh per-user temp dir. The returned absolute path is what the
// webview in Chunks 4-7 loads via `file://` (or as the nalar `--static-dir`
// argument) at app startup; `cleanup` is called on shutdown to remove
// the temp dir.
//
// Why temp + per-run: the assets are embedded in the binary (10+ MiB),
// but the nalar server's `--static-dir` only reads from disk. We unpack
// to a per-pid temp subdir so multiple concurrent nalar-desktop
// invocations don't collide. The subdir is created via
// `nalar-desktop-webapp-<pid>` and removed in cleanup().
//
// Zig 0.16 API notes:
//   * `std.posix.getenv` doesn't exist in 0.16; use `std.c.getenv`
//     (libc). It returns `?[*:0]const u8` (a NUL-terminated optional
//     pointer), not `?[]const u8`; we have to slice the value to a
//     regular `[]const u8` via `std.mem.span` before dupe'ing it.
//   * `std.os.linux.getpid()` is gone in 0.16; use `std.c.getpid()`
//     (libc). It returns `c_int` (a `pid_t` on Linux/macOS).
//   * `std.fs.cwd()` is gone in 0.16; the new API is `std.Io.Dir.cwd()`
//     which requires an Io handle. For a build/CLI-style helper that
//     just needs `mkdir` + `open` + `write` + `deleteTree` in a
//     synchronous flow, the libc `std.c.*` wrappers are simpler than
//     dragging in an Io runtime — they don't need io, they're blocking,
//     and they work cross-platform (Linux + macOS + Windows). The
//     earlier version of this file used raw `std.os.linux.*` syscalls
//     which compile fine on macOS but invoke Linux syscall numbers that
//     don't exist on the Darwin kernel — the process gets killed with
//     SIGSYS the moment the first `faccessat` runs. The libc wrappers
//     fix that without an Io dependency.

// ===== Tests merged from extraction_test.zig (2026-09-29 flatten) =====
// Tests for the runtime extraction module. Two test cases:
//
//   1. extract() writes every asset's bytes to a fresh temp dir, returns
//      an absolute path, and the on-disk files match the source content
//      byte-for-byte (including files in subdirectories, which test
//      extract's makePath-for-parent logic).
//   2. cleanup() removes the temp dir recursively.
//
// Both tests are pure CPU + filesystem; no networking or subprocesses.
// They use the system's default temp dir (`$TMPDIR` / `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` /
// `/tmp`), so a parallel test run on the same host could in theory
// collide — but `extract` puts each run in a per-pid subdir, so the
// collision window is essentially zero.
//
// Zig 0.16 API notes:
//   * `std.fs.cwd()` is gone, so file reads in the test use raw
//     `std.os.linux.open` + `read` syscalls (matching the patterns in
//     subprocess.zig and path_resolve.zig). The actual SUT code
//     (extraction.zig) also uses raw syscalls internally for the same
//     reason.
//   * The cwd-only stat for "did cleanup succeed?" uses faccessat(2)
//     with AT.FDCWD, which is a single syscall and doesn't need an
//     Io runtime.
