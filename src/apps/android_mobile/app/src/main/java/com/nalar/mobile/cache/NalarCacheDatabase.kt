/**
 * One SQLite file for all three offline caches.
 *
 * One database rather than three, because the three share a lifecycle: they are
 * written by the same three ViewModels, purged by the same sign-out, and are
 * all rebuildable from the network. Splitting them would triple the
 * connection pool, the WAL files, and the places a sign-out has to remember to
 * reach, for no isolation that a table name does not already give.
 *
 * ### `allowMainThreadQueries` is deliberate
 *
 * Room's default — throw if a query touches the main thread — exists because a
 * query that is "one row" in the schema can be "the whole table" at runtime.
 * Every read this database serves is the opposite: each one is a point lookup
 * on the primary-key prefix with a `LIMIT`, or a full delete for a table that
 * holds at most a few hundred short rows. The queries are in
 * [ChatCacheDao], [RecentsCacheDao] and [AuthMeCacheDao], and the reader can
 * check that claim in one sitting.
 *
 * More to the point, the call site is not new. `HomeViewModel` primes the
 * sidebar from cache on the main thread, and the store it used to prime from
 * was `EncryptedPrefs`, which does a Keystore AES-GCM decrypt of a blob on that
 * same main thread. A `LIMIT`ed index-backed point query is not merely
 * acceptable there, it is *cheaper* than what it replaced. Changing the reads
 * to suspend would be the honest fix, but it would put a coroutine hop between
 * the launch and the paint, and the tests that hold the ordering contract
 * (`HomeViewModelCacheTest.aCachedSidebarPaintsBeforeTheNetworkReturns`) would
 * be describing a first frame that no longer exists.
 *
 * Writes are the other way round: every caller wraps them in
 * `Dispatchers.IO` before reaching a cache, so they run off the main thread
 * anyway.
