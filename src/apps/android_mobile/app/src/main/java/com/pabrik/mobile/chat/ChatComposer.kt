/**
 * The chat's composer, built as the card the web's is: one bordered rounded
 * surface holding the text, the paperclip and the stop control on the first
 * row, a divider, and the turn's facts on the second.
 *
 * ### What is a control here and what is not
 *
 * The web's footer row is five dropdowns. Two of them are real on a phone: the
 * model, because a profile is picked from a list the server hands us and the
 * choice is persisted per session, and the `cwd` expander, because there is a
 * whole path hidden behind one line. The other three are wired to nothing, and
 * a dropdown that opens an empty menu is worse than no dropdown — it teaches
 * the reader that the footer is decoration. So those stay as text.
 *
 * The chevron is drawn only when there is a `cwd` to expand. A permanently
 * mounted expander is a control that lies about whether anything is hidden.
 *
 * ### The stop control lives here, not in the app bar
 *
 * It replaced the top-bar stop, so there is exactly one answer to "can I stop
 * this run". Two of them disagreeing — one present, one gone, during a
 * reconnect — is the same lie told twice, and a reader who has learned to
 * distrust the composer distrusts the send button too.
 *
 * ### Queue is a third control, and it sits *beside* the stop
 *
 * Sending a turn and queueing one are the same request — `POST /llm/session`
 * with a `queue_message` — and the server decides which it is: a worker that
 * is already live takes the message into `session_queue_messages` and drains
 * it when it finishes (`workflow.zig:688` and the loop check at
 * `workflow.zig:1565`), an idle one starts immediately. So the client never
 * picks a different endpoint; it only changes *when* it will let the reader
 * press send.
 *
 * That is what makes the queue button necessary and why it is not a second
 * send: a reader watching a three-minute tool call has a follow-up in their
 * head right now, and before this the only way to act on it was to stop the run
 * and restart it — throwing away the work in progress. Queueing is the third
 * verb, and it is neither of the other two, so it gets its own control rather
 * than a long-press nobody will discover.
 *
 * It appears only while there is something to queue. A queue button over an
 * empty box is a control that does nothing, which is the same lie this
 * composer already refuses to tell about the model chip and the cwd expander.
 *
 * ### Why `BasicTextField` and not `TextField`
 *
 * `TextField` draws its own container and indicator, and there is no way to
 * remove both without leaving a rounded grey block inside a rounded bordered
 * card — two frames for one input. The card is the frame here, so the field
 * draws text and a cursor and nothing else.

/**
 * The turns waiting behind the run, as a count that opens into a list.
 *
 * This is the web's `queuedMessages` panel (`FileInput.vue:753`) rebuilt for a
 * phone: the web puts the button on the input row beside the textarea, and
 * there is no room for it there — the row is already text, paperclip and send,
 * and a fourth control steals width from the only thing on the card the reader
 * came here to use. So the count is its own line above the text, which is
 * also where the reader's eye goes after queueing something.
 *
 * **Nothing queued means nothing drawn.** Not a zero, not a disabled chip: an
 * empty queue is the state the reader is in almost every turn, and a permanent
 * "0 queued" is a control that is telling them there is nothing on the only
 * row where something else might be.
 *
 * The list is re-read when it is *opened* rather than only on every frame:
 * between them, the rows on screen are built from SSE frames the reader can
 * watch arrive, and a drained turn that is still listed would have them
 * compose a duplicate of one the agent is already answering.
