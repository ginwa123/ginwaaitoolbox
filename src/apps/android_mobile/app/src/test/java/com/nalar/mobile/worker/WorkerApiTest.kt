/**
 * Pins the `/api/workers` contract the spinner depends on.
 *
 * A fixture only proves the parser agrees with itself; the wire test that pins
 * it against the server is `tests/functional/android_workers_contract_test.py`.
 * What these cases protect is the *shape handling* that fixture cannot show:
 * which of the two id fields is read, and what happens when a field is missing
 * or explicitly null.
