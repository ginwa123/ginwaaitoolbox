/**
 * The two cleartext lists have to be the same list.
 *
 * The store decides what a person may type and the **platform** decides what
 * the app is actually allowed to open, and those are two different files in two
 * different languages: `ServerUrl.kt` and
 * `src/debug/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`. Nothing in the build makes
 * them agree.
 *
 * When they disagree the failure is not a crash — it is worse than that. A store
 * that accepts `http://server.lan` while the platform refuses cleartext to
 * `server.lan` gives the person a setting that saves, shows the new host, and
 * then fails every request with a connect error they cannot interpret and have
 * no way to change. The symptom would land somewhere else entirely, a day later,
 * on a device that is not the developer's.
 *
 * So the lists are pinned to each other here. This is the same source-contract
 * shape `AuthConfigContractTest` uses for the build script, for the same
 * reason: Compose can report a rendered pixel and Robolectric can report a
 * preference write, and neither can read a policy out of an XML file this test
 * did not open itself.
