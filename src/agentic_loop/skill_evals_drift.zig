//! Tier 0 of a skill eval: the deterministic half. No LLM, no tokens.
//!
//! A skill names things — file paths, commands, `file:line` references. Those
//! are claims about the code as it is TODAY, and they can be checked
//! mechanically. Doing that here rather than asking a model to remember a
//! codebase is the difference between adjudicating a fact and recalling one,
//! and it means the cheapest and most common failure (a skill pointing at a
//! file that has since moved) costs nothing to detect.
//!
//! ## Tier 0 deliberately never reports severity `high`
//!
//! `skill_evals_db.decideVerdict` promotes any high-severity finding to
//! `delete`, and that is correct: some findings really do mean the skill must
//! go. A renamed path is not one of them. It means the skill needs UPDATING.
//! So this module caps severity at `medium`, which makes "Tier 0 can never
//! delete a skill" a structural property rather than a promise — deletion is
//! reserved for the LLM tier, which can judge that a skill's subject matter is
//! gone rather than merely moved.
//!
//! ## Why `statFile`, not `statFileAbsolute`
//!
//! The paths checked here come from LLM-authored prose, so they can be
//! relative, empty, or nonsense. Zig's `*Absolute` family ASSERTS on a
//! non-absolute path and aborts the whole process — a `catch` cannot save you,
//! because the panic fires inside the callee (PR #639's crash class).
//! `std.Io.Dir.cwd().statFile` is the path-based, assertion-free form, and an
//! error from it is exactly the signal wanted.
