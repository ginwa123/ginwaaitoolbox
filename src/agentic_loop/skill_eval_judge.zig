//! The Skill Evals judge: a fresh sub-agent per skill, filling the
//! SESSION-RELATIVE half of the rubric.
//!
//! ## What Tier 0 cannot do
//!
//! `skill_evals_drift.zig` checks whether the paths a skill names still exist.
//! That is intrinsic — it depends only on the body and the code state — and it
//! is structurally incapable of reaching `delete`, because no amount of
//! missing-path evidence proves a skill is worthless. "Was this the right
//! skill for this task, did the agent actually use it, did it help" needs the
//! session, and the session is what a sub-agent gets a fresh read of.
//!
//! ## The trust boundary
//!
//! `parseReport` turns generated TEXT into a `Report` and nothing else. It
//! does not decide whether that report may be believed. That is
//! `skill_evals_db.validateReport`, and the caller MUST run every parsed
//! report through it before storing anything. This module never writes to a
//! database — it cannot, it has no handle — so the boundary cannot be bypassed
//! from here even by accident.
//!
//! ## Unparseable means `needs_human`, never a guess
//!
//! `parseReport` returns null for anything it cannot read as a JSON object. A
//! judge that said something fluent and wrong is the single most expensive
//! failure this feature can have, so the only fallback is "a human looks at
//! this". There is no partial credit, no default verdict, no "probably keep".
//!
//! ## A score that does not fit the rubric is made to FAIL validation
//!
//! The parser maps a score that is negative, fractional, or above 255 to the
//! sentinel 255 rather than to 0. 0 is a valid (bad) score; 255 is not a score
//! at all, so `validateReport` refuses the report. Clamping down to 0 would let
//! a malformed report pass as a confidently-bad one, and clamping up to 3 would
//! let it pass as a confidently-good one. Both would be a guess.

        \\  used          — did the session actually apply it
        \\  helpfulness   — did applying it improve the outcome
