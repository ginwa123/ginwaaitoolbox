//! Matching + rendering for the `search_documents` agent tool.
//!
//! This is the documents-side twin of `skills_search.zig`: the same shape
//! (collect rows → match a query → page → render JSON), the same
//! `progressive_regex` engine, and the SAME `pattern_mode` /
//! `pattern_warning` / `total` / `next_offset` / `hint` contract that the
//! model already reads from `search_tool` and `search_skills`. One paging
//! convention across three catalogs is the whole point — a tool that
//! paginated differently would need its own mental model and would be
//! learned wrong at least once.
//!
//! It lives HERE rather than in `src/modules/agent/tools/document.zig`
//! because `progressive_regex` sits under `src/agentic_loop/` and a
//! `modules → agentic_loop` import would close a cycle through the
//! `pabrikcore` root. The tool schema + `SearchDocumentsInput` stay in
//! `document.zig`; `tools_exec_document.zig` wires the two together.
//!
//! What is DIFFERENT from skills, and why
//! ──────────────────────────────────────
//! 1. Bounded memory. A skill row is a name and a description. A document
//!    row carries a body capped at 4 MiB, so "read every row in the
//!    workspace and regex it" is a real allocation, not a formality. The
//!    fix is `literalPrefilter`: a SQL `LIKE` narrowing that runs before
//!    the bodies are loaded, and which is applied ONLY when it is provably
//!    a superset of what the regex would match. See that function.
//! 2. Excerpts. A hit that returns no body is a hit the model cannot
//!    act on when the next step is `edit_document` (a whole-body replace).
//!    So every row carries a bounded window around the match, and
//!    `include_content` opts into the real thing.
