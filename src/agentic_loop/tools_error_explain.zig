//! Model-facing explanations for the errors that reach a tool envelope.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Every `tools_exec_*.zig` adapter used to render a failure as
//! `<tool> failed: <@errorName>`. That string is written for a Zig
//! programmer, not for the model that has to repair its own next tool
//! call. `command failed: MandatoryTimeoutMissing` names no field, no
//! value and no fix, so the model retries the identical call — the
//! screenshot in the task shows four identical retries and then the
//! whole stream dying.
//!
//! `tools_exec_glob.zig` and `tools_exec_search.zig` already carried
//! hand-written per-error sentences. This module generalises that
//! pattern so every adapter can share one table instead of each
//! inventing its own wording (or, more often, not bothering).
//!
//! ## What a good message contains
//!
//! Three things, in this order:
//!
//!   1. WHAT was wrong, in the model's vocabulary ("the `mandatory_timeout`
//!      field is required").
//!   2. WHY it is required / what the constraint is ("it is the only
//!      deadline; there is no default").
//!   3. WHAT TO SEND instead ("add \"mandatory_timeout\": 30").
//!
//! A message that only names the Zig error fails all three. A message
//! that only says "invalid input" fails the third.
//!
//! ## Ownership
//!
//! `explain` ALWAYS allocates with `allocator` and the caller always
//! frees. That uniformity is deliberate: a mixed literal/allocated
//! return would force every call site to know which prong it hit, and
//! the one site that guessed wrong becomes a double-free or a leak. An
//! error path already allocates the envelope around this string, so one
//! more small allocation is free by comparison.
//!
//! ## Adding an entry
//!
//! Add a prong to the `switch` in `explain`. Zig requires every prong's
//! error name to be a member of the switched error set, so a prong for
//! an error that no caller can produce is a compile error — the table
//! cannot drift into naming errors that do not exist. The `else` prong
//! is the honest fallback: it keeps the raw error name (so a human
//! reading the log can still identify it) and adds the generic
//! "re-send valid arguments" advice.

const std = @import("std");

/// The generic advice appended to the fallback message. Kept as one
/// const so the wording cannot drift between call sites.
const FALLBACK_ADVICE =
    "Re-send the call with valid arguments. " ++
    "If the same error repeats, do not retry the identical call — " ++
    "change the arguments or report the blocker.";

/// Render `err` as a sentence the model can act on.
///
/// The result is allocated with `allocator`; the caller owns it.
///
/// `context` is optional and only read by the prongs that interpolate
/// one (path-shaped errors). Pass `null` everywhere else.
