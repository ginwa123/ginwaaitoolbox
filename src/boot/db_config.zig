//! The SQLite connection policy pabrik opens its database with.
//!
//! ONE place, because the daemon (`boot/server_boot.zig`) and the
//! `create-admin` CLI (`boot/cli_dispatch.zig`) open the SAME file: a CLI
//! that opened it with different pragmas would behave differently on the
//! same data, and that difference would only show up under load.
//!
//! Every value here comes from the ruangsql benchmark harness
//! (`sparringhttp`, sqlite scenario: 5000-row table, point read / list /
//! LIKE search / insert / update / delete, equal-spec 2-CPU container,
//! `wrk -c50`). The two that actually changed the numbers:
//!
//!   - `read_conns` — WAL allows MANY concurrent readers and exactly ONE
//!     writer, so opening extra read connections and serving reads from
//!     them is what moved a benchmark server's read throughput +270%
//!     (50k -> 185k rps on a 16-core host). Before it, every read queued
//!     behind one mutex, so a read waiting on a write inherited the write's
//!     latency.
//!
//!     `read_conns` is the WARM FLOOR, not the ceiling. The pool is elastic:
//!     a reader is owned exclusively by one read at a time (a connection
//!     with a live iterator has an open read transaction, and handing it to
//!     anybody else would serve them that stale snapshot), so when every
//!     reader is busy the pool opens another rather than making the next
//!     request wait. `max_read_conns = 0` leaves that unbounded.
//!
//!   - `cache_size_kb` — SQLite ships a 2 MiB page cache per connection.
//!     8 MiB is what the harness ran with. NOTE it MULTIPLIES by the
//!     connection count, and with an elastic pool the count is bounded by
//!     CONCURRENCY rather than by this file — see `page_cache_budget_kb`.
//!
//! `mmap_size_bytes` maps the database file instead of `read()`-ing it:
//! pages still come from the OS file cache, but each hit skips a syscall
//! and a copy, and it is file-backed — so unlike `cache_size` it does not
//! count against a container's `memory.max`.
//!
//! `synchronous = .full` fsyncs the WAL on every commit, so a write that
//! reports success survives a power cut. WAL's usual recommendation is
//! NORMAL (sync at checkpoints instead), which is faster but may lose the
//! last few commits on power loss. Pabrik's agent database is the one place
//! that must not lose them, so it pays the fsync — see the field comment on
//! `best` below.
//!
//! `busy_timeout_ms`, `journal_size_limit_bytes` and
//! `wal_autocheckpoint_pages` are stated explicitly rather than left to the
//! package so this struct is a COMPLETE description of the connection.
//! The 15 s timeout is the ruangsql#1 fix that turned "write lost after 5 s
//! with database is locked" into "write delayed".
